"I found the paper interesting and only had one (relatively large) issue and one small.","foo"
"The main issue is the 'black box', 'grey box' metrics and theme throughout the paper. I found that a bit contrived and distracting from a very good      paper. This is a key aspect of the paper, however the same thing could be highlighted without the use of the box analogy.","We understand the reviewer's concerns, and have tried a number of alternative ways to neatly summarise the two alternative approaches to metric calculation but could not find anything more suitable than 'black box' and 'grey box', which are recognised terminologies within systems engineering. However, to minimise distractions, we have reworded some sentences to remove superfluous mentions of 'black box' and 'grey box'. We removed 22 of the 68 mentions of either phrase, reducing their occurrence by 32 per cent."
"In the discussion section the exergy of waste and incineration is not fully consistent with life cycle assessments and overall waste programming. Refuse derived fuel may have great merit but mass burn incineration of mixed waste is generally not an appreciable source of energy (mainly waste disposal under the guise of EFW depending on season and locality).","We have changed our example from mass burn incineration to refuse derived fuel"
"In the manuscript, the authors compare some of the methodologies currently used to assess resource flow systems, in particular urban metabolism.  They   compare black box (”footprint”) indicators with grey-box measures such as exergy and network analysis.  The authors conclude that grey-box approaches     provide greater information and greater guidance for management intervention to improve system performance.  Overall, the manuscript is very well written and easy to read.  The authors do a very nice job covering a breadth of material.  The topic is timely and important given the emphasis on measuring      methods generally and urban metabolism specifically.","foo"
"My only hesitation is that the results are not surprising that the more detailed models are better, but nonetheless it is useful to demonstrate this     systematically.","foo"
"I think the manuscript can be published essentially as is, but would point out just a few minor aspects.","foo"
"First, the title should reflect that this is a comparison, because it is not the measured results per se here that are the novel results but rather the  indication of which approach is preferable.","We have changed the title to “Comparing performance metrics for multi-resource systems: the case of urban metabolism”"
"On page 15, line 41 I suggest adding two more references in addition to Finn 1976 - Hannon 1973 (which was the original application of Leontief I/O into ecology) and a reference by Patten (i.e., 1978 - Ohio Journal of Science) who was the main force behind this approach for decades.","To note Hannon and Patten's contributions, we have added the sentence, “ENA is based on work by Hannon, 1973 who adapted economic input-output analysis (Leontief, 1951) to quantify the interdependence of species within an ecosystem, and can be derived from the formal representation of interactions within the environment in Patten (1978).”"

"Figure 8, since you are mixing media please indicate the currency of the flows.    ","We have clarified this (a) in the text: “The results of these operations return an 'integral utility matrix' whose elements give a non-dimensional quantification of the combined direct and indirect exergy contributions to each compartment. We have displayed these results as directed graphs in Figure 8”; and (b) in the caption of Figure 8: “Directed graphs visualising the non-dimensionalised exergetic dependencies (direct and indirect) between compartments (the management of energy, water, waste and materials, as well as the area's internal and external environments). Arrow directions indicate mutualism and exploitation as for Figure 3; arrow thickness is proportional to the element value in the integral utility matrix.”"
"Figure 8: What do the arrows not connecting nodes but not crossing the boundary    represent?","This should be clear from the enumerated list in Section 4.2.2, but to emphasise the the role of non-nodal sectors, we have included a parenthetical clause in Figure 8's caption: “(the management of energy, water, waste and materials, as well as the area's internal and external environments)”."
"Figure 8: Why does Beijing have no material?","We assume the reviewer meant to raise this query about London, rather than Beijing. We have added a comment in Section 4.2.2, enumerated item (f) which notes that the the urban metabolism data for London does not include material sector flows."
"I found the discussion very useful and thoughtful.""","foo"
