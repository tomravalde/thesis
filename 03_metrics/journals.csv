Energy,4.159,4.465,"Only appropriate to publish here if we make the paper more narrowly focused on 'exergy' (since it incorporates 'Exergy, an international journal')."
"Journal of cleaner production",3.59,4.088,"Concepts, policies, technologies, products and services to progress towards more sustainable societies and regions. Through resource and energy efficiency. Research submissions can include 'improvements in the integration of environmental management systems'; 'advances in reduction of the life cycle usage of energy, water and other materials; and 'advances in industrial ecology and regional sustainable development'."
"Ecological indicators",3.23,3.384,"Aims to integrate monitoring and assesment of ecological and environmental indicators with management practices.  They will publish 'all spects of ecological and environemntal indicators and indices'; and 'new indicators, and new approaches and methods for indicator, testing and use'."
"The journal of industrial ecology",2.713,,"This journal addresses 'material and energy flows studies', dematerialisation, industrial symbiosis and eco-efficiency."
"Resources, conservation and recycling",2.692,3.026,"This journal considers sustainable management and conservation of resources, looking at the transition towards more sustainable production and consumption systems.  Contributions include 'information and management systems involving resource status, use and material flows in society'; and 'material flow analysis and the understanding of resourc euse and flows in society and the impact on the environment, including resource extraction and waste generation'. An example of a recent publication is 'Emergy evaluation of an integrated livestock wastewater treatment system.'"
"Ecological modelling",2.326,2.54,"This journal uses mathematical models and systems analysis to describe sustainable resource management. Previous publications include 'Use of eco-exergy in ecological networks'; 'Integrated urban ecosystem evaluation and modeling based on embodied cosmic exergy; and 'Exergy-based resource accounting for China'."
"Environmental management",1.65,2.1,"Covers use and conservation of natural resources' and should be relevent to 'international audiences' "
