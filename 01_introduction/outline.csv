"Chapter","Objective","Contribution to thesis","Contribution to the field"
"1","\textbf{Objective 1:} Research the links between urbanisation trends, and resource management challenges and opportunities to motivate the thesis.","Define the research question.",
"2","\textbf{Objective 2(a):} Research the urban metabolism concept which provides a theoretical framework to assess urban resource consumption. \newline \textbf{Objective 2(b):} Research modelling methods used currently in designing for sustainable resource management.","Locate this research question within the existing literature.","Identify theoretical and methodological opportunities and gaps in the literature and so advance the UM framework providing a new way to conceptualise the way a city relates to its resource flows."
"3","\textbf{Objective 3:} Determine metrics to quantify performance of multi-resource systems, appropriate to measure the success at meeting environmental and economic challenges.","Propose the theory which can be used to assess an area's metabolism (and so assess the results of modelling).","Determine metrics appropriate to quantify the performance of an area's metabolism (work published in \citet{Ravalde2015a})."
"4","\textbf{Objective 4:} Systematically research the processes likely to influence urban metabolism between now and 2030 (to provide model inputs).","Assemble data for use in the model.","Assemble an open-source database of the resource management processes over the coming years (work published in \citet{Ravalde2016})."
"5","\textbf{Objective 5:} Develop the mathematical formulation and the computational implementation of the model.","Formulate the modelling method.","Development of the model using a benchmark test case which others can use as a starting point to further develop the model."
"6","\textbf{Objective 6:} Apply the model to a case study to demonstrate resource integration.","Apply the model to a case study.","Demonstration of model to show how it might be employed by decision makers. (Early version of this work published in \citet{Ravalde2015}.)"
"7","\textbf{Objective 7:} Evaluate the success and implications of the model.","Answer the research question, and propose an agenda for future research.",
