# Tat Hamlet details {#sec:tat-details}

This Appendix contains further details about the Tat Hamlet benchmarking study which was used to develop the PRaQ formulation in Chapter \ref{sec:model-dev}. The code to run the benchmarking models is available at \url{https://github.com/tomravalde/model-development-code/tree/develop}, which contains instructions on how the run the benchmarking study with the Null, PRaQ and Nonlinear formulations.

## Changes made to Tat Hamlet data for the benchmarking study {#sec:tat-changes}

Section \ref{sec:tat-case-study} noted that for the purposes of the benchmarking study, some simplifications, assumptions and additions were made. These are listed below.

\begin{description}

\item [Simplifications] help ensure the benchmark study is user-friendly:

\begin{itemize}
\item The commercial sector (i.e. the shops, which sells 'final goods') will be ignored. These goods are directly imported, and are thus not managed by processes, so add nothing to the benchmark study
\item Amalgamate all livestock (chickens, dogs, buffalo, and cows) into a single 'livestock' category which produces all livestock products in the village (meat, dairy, and manure).
\item Amalgamate all agricultural activities into a single 'agriculture' category which produces all agricultural produced in the village (firewood, swidden, green manure, vegetables)
\end{itemize}

\item [Assumptions] account for the fact that the literature does not resolve Tat's energy flows down to their final use:

\begin{itemize}
\item Tat's total electricity use are split equally between domestic, agriculture, and water pumping purposes.
\item Tat's total heat output  = 5375.6 GJ/year \citep{Heezen2003}. Assume this is split between domestic heating, cooking, and domestic hot water
\end{itemize}

\item [Additions] give the benchmarking study greater ability to test different types of formulation:

\begin{itemize}
\item For the purpose of this study, a dam is added to the village. This generates electricity from the river water. As shown below, this will enable two types of linear formulation, and one type of nonlinear to be compared for their performance.
\item Each household will include cooking, space heating, and hot water heating processes.
\item The literature does not provide any spatial information regarding the point of demand and the location of processes. In order that the benchmarking can consider spatial disaggregation, Tat will be divided into four zones (each of which have equal demands for resources).
\end{itemize}

## Explaining the difference between the models with reference to a pipe, pump and dam system {#sec:pipe-pump-dam}

Section \ref{sec:derivations} developed both linear and nonlinear models. This section uses the example of a pipe-pump-dam system (Figures \ref{fig:pump-dam-example} and \ref{fig:pump-dam-RTN}) to explain the differences in how they might differently model some phenomena. The models need to calculate the pumping energy and water volumes required at point A to raise the water to a sufficient height at point B, that will allow the dam to generate enough electricity to meet demand at point C. This box expresses this problem using equations of fluid mechanics, before showing how it would be modelled by the three formulations. The starting point is to use the Bernoulli equation, which states that along a streamline of fluid of density $\rho$, energy is conserved:

\begin{figure}

	\begin{spacing}{1.0}
	\sffamily
	\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\input{05_model-development/pipe-dam-example.pdf_tex}}
	\end{spacing}
	\caption{An example to illustrate the difference between model formulations. There are two zones. Zone 2 has an electricity demand which can be met by a dam (a conversion process), also in zone 1. However, the water must first be pumped (via the pump -- a conversion process in zone 1) and transported to zone 2 via a pipe (transport process).}
	\label{fig:pump-dam-example}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{05_model-development/pipe-dam-network.pdf}
	\caption{An RTN representation of Figure \ref{fig:pump-dam-example}. The electricity (E) required by the pump can be imported from outside the system; the amount required depends on the mass of water (W) to be pumped, and the elevation to which it needs pumping. The dashed arrow indicates that the electricity in Zone 2 is a demand.}
	\label{fig:pump-dam-RTN}
\end{figure}


\begin{align}
\frac{P}{\rho g} + z + \frac{v^2}{2g} = \mbox{constant}
\end{align}

where at a chosen point $P$ is the water's pressure, $z$ is it's elevation with respect to a reference, and $v$ is it's velocity ($g$ is the constant of acceleration due to gravity).

First, consider the water flow from A (zone 1) to B (zone two) via the combination of a pump and a pipe. The pump provides the energy to raise the water's elevation and has an electrical efficiency of $\eta^{pump}$. This energy includes that which is required to overcome the energy loss due to friction. Typically this friction loss is defined as a function of the pipe's length $l$ and diameter $D$ as $\mbox{friction loss} = f_D(l/D)(v^2/2g)$ (where $f_D$ is the Darcy Friction Factor). It is also assumed that $P_1=P_2$ and that $v_1=v_2=v$, and that the datum is measured from A and C (which are at equal height), thus $z_A=z_B=0$. Finally, the models formulated later work with mass ($m$) and energy balances, thus it is convenient to multiply each term by $mg$. The resulting equation gives the water's energy at points A and B expressed in terms of mass:

\begin{align}
%z_A  + \eta^{pump} \frac{\mbox{pump energy}}{\rho V g}  = z_B + F \frac{l}{D} \frac{v^2}{2g}
\eta^{pump} \cdot (\mbox{pump energy})  = m \left( gz_B + f_D \frac{l}{D} \frac{v^2}{2} \right) 
\end{align}

Second, consider the flow across the dam, between $B$ and $C$. Using the same assumptions as above, and defining the dam with an electrical generation efficiency, $\eta^{dam}$, and again multiplying through by $mg$, the relationship of water input attributes to the dam's electrical output is:

\begin{align}
mgz_B = \eta^{dam} \cdot (\mbox{electricity generated})
\label{eq:damEnergy}
\end{align}

Considering the dam example, the variables that the null model calculate are the mass of water passing into and out of the dam $m$, and the electricity generated ($e^{dam}$. The electricity is considered the dam's 'main' output, and hence its output coefficient is set to  1 MJ\footnote{This means that the process's rate, $F_{pz}$ becomes a one-to-one mapping of the resource production, which in this case is the dam's power.}

The other process coefficients are then defined relative to this electricity output using Equation \ref{eq:damEnergy}. For the model to remain linear, the water's elevation head (i.e. the dam height, $z_B$) cannot be considered a variable, thus the model requires a dam to be defined with fixed height. Therefore, assuming a dam of height $z_B=11$ metres and efficiency $\eta^{dam}=$ 80 percent, the mass of water required to produce a megajoule of electricity is 12,742 kg. The dam example has two 'water' resources (one high-head, the other low-head); other water resources could include water at different temperatures or contamination levels.
