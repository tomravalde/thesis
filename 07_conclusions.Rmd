Optimisation modelling in general, and synergy-exploiting optimisation modelling is not far away from UM, and has been successfully applied in Industrial Ecology, especially as a means to integrate the operations of multiple facilities within Eco-Industrial Parks. This thesis has brought optimisation into the broader field

To provide goods and services, cities are places of both great challenge and opportunities. In sustaining ever-growing populations in search of an improving quality of life, urban resource management needs are confronted by economic and environmental challenges. 

Our introduction showed that the energy, water and waste sectors interact, 
but in urban areas it is possible for these interactions to become synergies, by harnessing the co-location of infrastructure for 

Reflecting upon the proximity of urban resource management processes in urban areas gave rise the idea of using the principles of industrial ecology at the urban level to improve UM as a whole. Looking to the ideas systems optimisation modelling in other sectors could proved a method to make this possible.

People have been using models to address complicated problems; to simplify complicated systems into ;

address the complexity of the problem with computational methods which use in effect quite easily understood equations, and datasets.

This work has been stated/formulated in terms of ‘urban metabolism’, since this is a research field which brings together various aspects of the study of urban areas in relation to their patterns of resource use, and thus provides an overarching framework, into which this work can speak and advance. 

This thesis has argued that to date, the UM has not yet sufficiently accounted for how an area's mix of resource management processes -- in this work, defined as the 'middle' of an urban system -- affects the aggregate exchanges of resources with the environment. 

This thesis has proposed that in view of the challenges posed by urbanisation, optimisation modelling should be adopted to help planners take advantage of intersectoral synergies. The model developed in this thesis achieved this by adding to the rliterature on resouce management, a generic MILP model at the urban scale which highly integrates the energy, water and waste management systems.

Related to this, this thesis has explored the best way to understand the efficiency of an area’s metabolism.

To that end, a deterministic mathematical description of a system's middle has been formulated, Along the way, this thesis has advanced understanding of a system’s middle, formalising a heirarchical representation,

However, a mere mathematical description of the middle of a system is not sufficient to explore these questions, and thus we assembled a database of over 300 processes which a city might use in its management of energy, water and waste, which provides data for the model.

## Summary

Following an introduction to important motivations and themes, the research question posed at the end of Chapter 1 was:

> *By how much can an area's metabolism be quantifiably improved by an optimisation model which integrates the planning of energy, water and waste systems?*

Thus the challenge and opportunity can be summarised thus: increasing popultations, environmental and economic challenges, interactions and synergies, co-location
and led us to propose the following research question:

The first aim of the thesis was to *"Investigate the opportunity and methodology"*. Chapter 2 began this aim by proposing an engineered-system perspective of urban metabolism, which seeks to understand a city's aggregate metabolic flows as a function of the network of processes that manage and transport energy, water and waste. Formalising this concept would enable the formulation of a model which could optimise flows of multiple resource types at a low (i.e. management process) level in an attempt to consider energy, water and waste systems in a highly integrated manner.

With a new conceptual model proposed, Chapters 3 and 4 showed how this could be used. The first of these chapters showed how metabolism could be quantified by using different types of metrics (subsequently to be applied to systems designed by the model). The second assembled a dataset of energy, water and waste management processes which could be used to support the process-oriented UM studies (subsequently to provide data to the model).

With the groundwork laid, the second aim was to *"Develop a model which computes the optimal mix of resources to meet demand for goods and services"*. To that end, Chapter 5 developed an existing formulation for an urban energy systems model, to extend it to incorporate energy, water and waste models, even taking into account the different attributes of resource types. A benchmarking study showed that the PRaQ method achieved the best balance of model fidelity, size, computational cost, constructability, flexibility, and generality.

Finally, the third aim was to *"Assess how well the models improve urban metabolism"*. This was addressed in Chapter 6 by applying the PRaQ model to the SPC case study, and showing how optimal process mixes, and schedules of process operation, resource imports/exports, and performance metrics varied according to different design objectives and process availability.

## Implications for urban metabolism

Since the first conceptual model of UM as a black-box was proposed by @Wolman1965, others have been developing the idea, to increase its explanatory power, for example with @Newmann1999 adding 'liveability' to the idea of resource flows. Other additions were proposed by @Giradet1990, who modelled the re-use of a city's outputs as inputs, to show how a city's overall resource throughput could be reduced. Finally, @Zhang2009a suggested that inside the black-box was a network of economic sectors between which resources would be transferred. The main theoretical contribution of this thesis is to extend Zhang's network concept to include the engineered processes which convert and transport resources. 

The power of conceptual models is that they provide the concepts (and the associated language), to start relating parts of the modelled reality in ways that can further understanding of how that reality works. In this case¸ UM can now use the new framework to conceptualise how energy, waste and waste management processes in the 'middle' of a system affects the aggregate metabolic flows at the top of a system, as they are driven by demands at the bottom. 

In thinking more about the middle of a system, as made up of energy, water, and waste management processes, it becomes of interest to start mapping the real-world challenge -- namely, the possibility of using wastes and by-products of one sector as inputs to another -- to the model. This gave rise to the idea of having 'highly integrated' systems optimisation at the urban scale to simulataneously meet the demands of more than one system. This second theoretical contribution means that part of the discussion in how to improve urban metabolism can now more easily incorporate the idea that different sectors should work together.

It was assistance of that cause that wrought the main methodological contribution of this thesis. This was the formalisation of the relationships between the engineered processes of the middle, and between the middle as a whole in connection to the top and the bottom. These were mathematically formalised in the energy and mass balances, and other constraints that make up the PRaQ model. Thus field of urban metabolism now has its own optimisation model, something previously only enjoyed by individual sectors, and thus arguably did not do much to in the way of metabolism as a whole. 

The idea of highly integrated urban resource management systems did raise questions about how the performance of multi-resource systems should be best quantified. Chapter 4's answer to this provides another theoretical contribution to advocate for grey-box metrics to understand what's going on inside a UM system. The grey-box method of ENA also provides a point of contact between Zhang's conceptual model, and this one, via ENA. The engineered system's processes in PRaQ each belong to different economic sectors, and so it is possible to see how integrated systems (before or after optimisation) perform as a set of economic sectors.

Some specific outcomes of the SPC case study offer a very initial view of the way UM systems may go in the future, to achieve more sustainable designs. One avenue of exploration is the use of systems with more process types (particularly of a smaller capacity), in a decentralised network, rather than the more traditional centralised systems. This is a move that is already happening within individual sectors (e.g. energy supply and water supply), so the SPC modelling results suggest that this can be coupled with advances in intersectoral synergies, with waste- and by-products cascading down through a system [TODO: provide reference]. The use of wildcard type modelling might inform best what new technologies are particularly worthy of further R&D, in order to fit best into existing systems. Research could 

- Hidden savings: don't forget that (unlike energy optimisation models), the water and waste flows for energy processes are considered!
- More processes may also give more flexibility to respond to adapt operation upon changing consumer demands.

In summary, the contribution of the PRaQ model (built upon the theoretical idea of a system middle that can incorporate high systems integration) shows that the process-oriented perspective of UM is a fruitful avenue of research, which can now enable (the to date unexplored) of optimisation modelling. In this way, the study of UM is now placed to answer questions about how cities can improve their metabolism through systems integration. Because an actual tool has been provided, planners, policymakers and decision makers have a tool which can help them think about UM as a whole, rather than individual sectors as a part. 

## Implications for research

One component of this thesis is to encourage use of the conceptual model and the PRaQ implementation to continue, in particular through the growing community and opensource ecosystem within UM and IE [TODO: cite Davis etc.]. To that end, this thesis features two contributions. The first is the opensource database of resource management processes for others to use in their own work. Furthermore, the database can be extended and edited by others, meaning the possibilities to study urban metabolism from a process-oriented perspective can grow and grow. More than that, the method of systematically reviewing the literatures to assemble the database processes may find useful application in urban metabolism and other fields.

The second contribution is the benchmarking problem along with the different formulations of the optimisation modelling. This will allow others to tweak the model for their own purposes, and to develop it to do new things.

The opensource tools form something akin to an 'ecosystem', rather than a static set of components. This means that uses of the benchmarking problem and database are not limited to those exhibited here; but can be used in other work. Similarly, the opensource outputs of other work could be incorporated into the thesis. Possible developments and alternative uses in both the model and the database are suggested in the following section.

## Shortcomings and further work

The work of this thesis can be summarised as the coming together of four ideas -- urban metabolism, industrial ecology, systems optimisation modelling, and opensource -- upon which the PRaQ model has been built and applied. This thesis has focussed on introducing this collocation of ideas and how they might be applied. However, the focus has been upon introducing the idea, and thus some detail has been sacrificed for the sake of introducing a new idea to UM. Thus the early nature of this work means there is much more value to be squeezed out from the contributions of this thesis towards using PRaQ to improve urban metabolism.

Some specifics have already been proposed in earlier chapters
[TODO: summarise already-proposed further work]

### The concept

- work on the metrics

	1. confirm findings with other datasets
	2. higher resolution for grey-box analysis
	3. additional metrics (e.g. decomposition analysis)
	4. application to other MR systems

### The model

Secondly, the PRaQ formulation can be developed, perhaps introducing separate categories of technologies which distinguish between domestic and non-domestic technologies, and introducing storage technologies [@Keirstead2013, equations 9.3--9.10, pp166--170]. It could also incorporate 'hierarchical non-uniform time discretization' which is a sophisticated way to consider the variation in resource demand over hourly, daily¸ weekly, and seasonal periods, at lower computational cost than considering continuous profile over a long period [@Keirstead2013, p161]. Another addition to the formulation could be a device's spatial footprint. [TODO -- Note to James: domestic techs, and spatial footprint are considered in the unpublished paper, but not the book chapter.]

Other types of formulations can also be investigated, including the nonlinear approaches. Whilst such approaches were rejected in this thesis, ther are 
Linear formulations are appropriate to the superstructure representation as a first approximation

- model formulation
	- nonlinear (NLP, GAs/heuristics), (requiring a library of nonlinear process descriptions)
	- piecewise linear (requires extra data)
- Distinction between domestic and nondomestic processes
- Validation

Developments such as these would be 
facilitaed by the benchmarking problem

### The application

- In addition to the suggestions at the end of Chapter 6 (modifications to the set of input procedsses, refinements to process and resource costs, operational activity (more timesteps), alternative objectives, sensitivity analysis.
- user-interface
- data
- case studies
	- apply 'backwards' to real cities (validation)
- different applications: smaller-scale, larger-scale, joined up, hard/soft-linked to other models
- Further case studies
  	- long-term time horizon planning (can be performed with the current formulation)
  	- apply to modify systems with currently fixed components
	- short-term operation (using heirarchical time discretisation, above)


### Locating the concept within a broader set of considerations

Other further work concerns a zoomed-out view

Moving from considering the metabolic **flows**, and turning our attention to the socioeconomic **functions**, work should consider how our model can be applied within the broader socioeconomic systems. In our case study, the modeller has complete control over energy, water, and waste management sectors. While the operator of a single system (such as an energy supplier) might have such control, different resources are often managed by different actors, each seeking to maximise their own profits and incentives [TODO: reference]. Plausibly therefore, this modelling work could contribute to arguments which favour planned utilities management over free-market management, a debate ongoing anyway with the increasing interest in Smart cities [TODO: reference].

- Socioeconomics: Perhaps one reason for the lack of multi-resource synergy optimisation problems (as shown by our literature review) are the economic/market limitations. For example, typically, energy, water and waste are managed separately [TODO: cite specifics from around the world].
	- Perhaps this work can inform the debate surround market/planned economies
	- Perhaps it can help different (private/public) non-competative companies to work together (as in EIPs),
	- Alternatviely, ABM can be used

### Other ways to apply the modelling framework

- Upscaling and downscaling the principles to within-building, area, city, region, national, international levels (and associated data requirements, both for demands, and processes)

- Extended focus, i.e. range of demands (e.g. iron and steel manufacture, which can be significant components of an urban metabolism). This would have a corresponding extended range of 
- Supported by a other databases


### The UM modelling community and platform

Firstly, more data can be contributed to the @Ravalde2016 database (e.g. process costs, appropriate to specific locations and currencies). 

Python (e.g. Calliope)

Reference Chris Davis, and other online/github repositories of stuff.

- Data
  	- contributions to our process database
  	- urban metabolic demands for global cities
  	- existing infrastructure systems for existing cities
	- The above two points can then be combined, along with the notion of 'fixed components', to suggest how a particular city might move to optimising its resource system.
- From Chapter 4:
  	1. Adding new processes
  	2. Broader set of infor for each process
  	3. Extension to, e.g., steel and concrete manufacturing
	4. semantic web ecosystem: linked to structured and unstructured information, in which the top, middle, and bottom of UM systems

## Summary

In seeking to address important challenges about urban resource management, this thesis has brought together ideas and methods: (a development to the urban metabolism framework, with industrial ecology, systems optimisation modelling, and opensource, and proven this partnership sucessful. If the ideas (namely the concept, the modelling method, the data sources, this will help address some of the big global challenges, by 

Models advance understanding of a system, by explicitly representing that system in a way that could be questioned and developed -- an insight powerfully expressed by Professor Joshua Epstein in the epigraph above. The PRaQ model seeks to do that for a particular aspect of cities, namely integrated resource management.

We hope that the PRaQ model formulated in this thesis serves this purpose, and that furthermore, the developments we have proposed here (and hope that others propose) serve to advance work in UM, in order that the energy, water and waste sectors might work better together, as cities take advantage of their opportunities to help the world become more economically and environmentally sustainable.

In conclusion, in an increasingly resource-constrained world which faces the combined challenges of population growth, global warming, water scarcity, and shrinking landfill capacity, cities are being hailed as the most efficient means to provide goods and services. However, to take full advantage of this, cities should exploit their co-location of processes to benefit from synergies between energy, water and waste management systems. Our model is one step further along the journey to that end.

Even with the case study, this work has largely advanced UM *theory*, but the proposed scheme of further work will move the principles into practice. With this, it is hoped that this thesis can help to meet the environmental and economic challenges of cities.

In summary then, this thesis has answered the research question with theory, data, a modelling method, and a case study. The approach has brought together three fields of research: urban metabolism, industrial ecology, and systems optimisation.
