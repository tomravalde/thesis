Nevertheless, current urban metab olism models quantify environmental impacts but do not model the activities that drive thoe impacts. They identify symptoms without diagnosing the root problems. Metabolism models are limited in prescribing meaningful policies that are aims at the root cases mainly becausae they do not quantify the economic activities that drive the metabolism.” So this paper integrates with economic drivers. “statistical relationnships that approximate the long-term urban macroeconomic cycle”. f(population, outputs, labour) – fig. 2.
