# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Urbanisation has and will continue to bring socioeconomic well-being to an ever-growing global urban population, but they need to use resource more sustainably. One way to do this, is to take advantage of the fact that in cities, resource management infrastructure from the energy, water and waste sectors is co-located, such that the wastes and by-produces of one process can become the inputs to another.

To help planners and policy makers realise these benefits, this thesis introduces a mixed-integer linear programme which can choose the optimal mix of energy, water and waste management processes simultaneously, thereby taking into account the synergies and interactions between these sectors.

Formulating this model advances understanding of the urban metabolism concept, by showing how a city's mix of process affects its overall metabolic flows. Application of the model shows how it is possible to improve an area's metabolism, as measured by appropriate metrics. In summary, it is recommended that process-oriented approaches to urban sustainability should be considered in view of urban challenges.

In practice, planning a city's mix of processes and schedule of resource imports, exports, and inter-process transfers is nontrivial due to the many permutations and combinations involved, but formalising a city's network of resource management infrastructure as a system enables optimisation modelling

So that planners and policy makers can take advantage of optimisation modelling, this thesis introduces a usable and tractable optimisation mode which can choose the optimal mix of processes a city should use to manage its resources according to a given objective (such as minimising emissions).
