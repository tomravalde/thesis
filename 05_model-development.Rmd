- [TODO: ref metric paper] showed that so-called 'grey-box' metrics (i.e. exergy-based and ENA-based) provide particularly helpful insights on urban resource efficiency.
	- Background section on precedent modelling: justify chosen metrics (e.g. exergy) with respect to Ravalde and Keirstead (2015), and justify omission of cost (one reason, is that our data included future technologies, i.e. as yet uncosted. Futhermore, 'costable' processes still vary around the world, due to exchange rates and differences in purchasing power, and furthermore, will change as a f(time)).
-->

Our model will consider a city as divided into a number of zones, for which can be specified demands for resource management, and which can contain the processes which convert resources. These zones also possess connections to other zones for resource transportation, and to outside the city for importing and exporting. To this end, our models will be based on the model by @Keirstead2013a which we introduced earlier as a high-level MILP model to plan urban energy resource systems.

To model the processes which convert resources, @Keirstead2013a looks to the engineering State-Task Network model of @Kondili1993, in which processes ('tasks') convert materials from one 'state' to another. Keirstead's model applies the same principles to urban energy systems in a so-called Resource-Technology Network (RTN), developing a model which chooses the mix of processes that uses available resources to meet demand for heat and electricity. While @Keirstead's model is categorised as having no system integration, the State-Task network representation is highly generalised (i.e. all conversion processes are represented by the same type of equation), thus the formulation can be easily extended to consider resources and processes from multiple sectors.

Like Keirstead's model, processes are separated into conversion processes (such as a wastewater treatment plant) and transport processes (such as a pipeline). The transport processes will connect the different zones into which an urban area is divided, allowing resources to be transported to and from different parts of the city. The main equation is a resource balance,

\begin{align}
I_{rzt} + \sum_p^P G^{(qty)}_{przt} + \sum_{\tau} V^{(qty)}_{rzt\tau} &= D^{(qty)}_{rzt} + E_{rzt},
\label{eq:bal_qty}
\end{align}

which specifies the amount of a particular resource $r$ at any given time $t$ in zone $z$. The demand $D^{(qty)}$ parameter is specified by the user, and the model will choose the resource quantity imported into the city $I$, exported from the city $E$, generated by conversion processes $G$, and net inflow from other zones $V$ (referred to as 'variables'). Like Keirstead's model, the resources are expressed in terms of quantities (such as MW of electricity or kg/s of solid waste), which in our equations is denoted by the $^{(qty)}$ superscript. However, here we evolve Keirstead's formulation, by defining resource flows in terms of their *quality*, such that a resource can be attributed with both an energy and a mass. This is useful as we consider interaction between different sectors. Consider a body of water: this can supply (for example) both cooling for industrial processes, and hydroelectric electricity -- in our model we would need to know both its mass, and its energy head due to elevation. Thus the formulation specifies an equation analogous to \eqref{eq:bal_qty} which defines flows in terms of their quality (using the $^{(qual)}$ superscript notation):

\begin{align}
X_{rq} I_{rzt} + \sum_p^P G^{(qual)}_{prqzt} + \sum_{\tau}^T V^{(qual)}_{\tau rqzt} &= D^{(qual)}_{rqzt} + X_{rq} E_{rzt} \qquad \forall q,
\label{eq:bal_qual}
\end{align}

This introduces the quality index $q$, and the parameter $X$ which defines a resource's quality[^qual-param] which is a multiplier of any resource quantity value, such that it separates a quantity into its qualities.

[^qual-param]: For example, 1 kg of static water at a 10 m elevation would have an energy head of 98.1 J. Thus $X_{rq}$ would be defined as $X_{\mbox{water, mass}} = 1$, $X_{\mbox{water, energy}} = 98.1$.

The variable $G$ denotes the net quality of resource produced by a conversion process in a zone at a particular time. Conversion processes are modelled as black boxes with resource inputs and outputs, defined by the coefficients $k^{proc}_{prq}$:

\begin{align}
G^{(qual)}_{prqzt} &= k_{prq} F_p,
\label{eq:conv_qual}
\end{align}

The variable $F_p$ defines the operation rate of a process $p$ which can run between a range of values (e.g. a power plant's maximum operating capacity). Using the $X_{rq}$ parameter, we can formulate the quantity version of \eqref{eq:conv_qual}:

\begin{align}
X_{rq}G^{(qty)}_{przt} &= k_{prq} F_{pzt},
\label{eq:conv_qty}
\end{align}

<!--
This equation only needs to be applied in the case where a process $p$ produces or consumes resource $r$ with qualities $q$, hence the condition based on the $\delta_{prq}$.
-->
Transport processes are defined similarly to conversion processes, using coefficients to represent the relative quantities of resources involved in the transfer from one zone to another, to calculate the variable $V$ for each zone, as the net inflow of a resource ($\mbox{summed inflow from all other zones} - \mbox{summed outflow to all other zones}$):

\begin{align}
V^{(qual)}_{\tau rqzt} = &\sum_{z'} (k^{\alpha}_{\tau rq} + k^{\beta}_{\tau rq} l_{zz'}) F^{transp}_{\tau zz't} + \\
+ &\sum_{z'} (k^{\alpha'}_{\tau rq} + k^{\beta'}_{\tau rq} l_{z'z}) F^{transp}_{\tau z'zt}
\label{eq:transp_qual}
\end{align}

Coefficients and process rates are defined for transport technology $\tau$, both for the zone of origin $z$, and the zone of destination $z'$ (where the $'$ notation indicates the destination zone). Furthermore, the quantity of input resources can be defined by the linear sum of two coefficients, denoted by $\alpha$ and $\beta$. For example to transport 1 kg of coal from $z$ to $z'$ (defined by $k_{\tau rq}^{\alpha}=-1$, $k_{\tau rq}^{\alpha'}=1$) will require a quantity of petrol dependent on the distance between the zones $l_{zz'}$, thus defined by $k_{\tau rq}^{\beta}$ and $k_{\tau rq}^{\beta'}$. In the case where transport losses occur (such as electricity transported via a cable), $k^{\alpha}_{\tau rq} > k^{\alpha'}_{\tau rq}$. To calculate the quantity flows, we once again use the $X_{rq}$ parameter:

\begin{align}
X_{rq}V^{(qty)}_{\tau rzt} = &\sum_{z'} (k^{\alpha}_{\tau rq} + k^{\beta}_{\tau rq} l_{zz'}) F^{transp}_{\tau zz't} + \\
+ &\sum_{z'} (k^{\alpha'}_{\tau rq} + k^{\beta'}_{\tau rq} l_{z'z}) F^{transp}_{\tau z'zt}
\label{eq:transp_qty}
\end{align}

Finally, the model will minimise some objective, for example, the cost of resource imports:

\begin{align}
\min\left\{\sum_{rzt} \mbox{cost}_r I_{rzt}\right\}
\label{eq:ob}
\end{align}

Equations \eqref{eq:bal_qty}--\eqref{eq:ob} form the programme's main constraints. For a full description, see Appendix [TODO: cross-ref to appropriate appendix] which lists other constraints (such as upper limits imposed on resource imports). The formulation includes continuous variables (such as resource quantities and process rates), integer variables (the number of conversion processes in a zone), and binary variables (for the existence of a transport process between two zones). All equations are linear, resulting in a mixed-integer linear programme (MILP).

As for implementation, our model requires both its equations to be encoded in a programming language which can be solved using MILP solvers (such as CPLEX or Gurobi), and the parameter data which defines the demands, process-behaviour and other constraints. These two elements are kept separate, making it convenient to generate different models for convenience. The data are stored in CSV and YAML text files, both of which are chosen for their human-readability and their ease of editing:

- CSV files specify any data with a spatial element, including the layout, the demands, import/export limits, etc. These have the advantage of being editable using spreadsheet software.
- YAML[^yaml] files define both resources and processes [TODO: further detail] in a human-readable format. This format allows data to be stored heirarchichally (i.e. nested like sub-items and sub-sub items in an itemized list).

[^yaml]: "YAML ain't a markup language". This format is more human-readable than other heirarchical data storage formats approaches such as XML and JSON.

To define a particular model instance, a configuration YAML specifies which YAML and CSV files), and R code then writes a GAMS script which combines the data with the code.

There is no doubt that modelling has helped planners and policy makers design systems to manage resources to optimal performance in cities. However, to date, energy, water and waste resources have been managed with their own separate modelling tools. But by neglecting the synergies between different resource types, these approaches limit the resource savings a city can make. Thus we have adapted @Keirstead2013a's urban energy systems model to introduce a new model which optimises an urban area's resource-technology management, by choosing an appropriate technology mix and a corresponding schedule of resource imports and exports. Using the database of @Ravalde2016, we have applied the model to a Chinese urban development case study, for [TODO: number] scenarios.

[TODO: discuss the middle of the system]
<!--
Despite a gallimaufry of urban metabolism models and resource optimisation models, there is still need for an integrated model, to meet ambitions for intersectoral urban synergies. We have begun this processes, developing @Keirstead2013a's model to create a generically defined [TODO: complete...]

In this paper, we have adapted the urban energy systems model of [TODO: cite Keirstead et al.] to formulate a new model which simultaneously optimises the management of energy, water and waste, to improve the metabolism of an area, and applied it to a new urban development in China, using data collected for @Ravalde2015b.
-->
In addition to contributing a model for use in research, planning and policy, our results have showed that for the Shann Gu site, an objective (e.g. minimising cost, emissions, or some other quantity) is more readily met by taking advantage of more process types (particularly of a smaller capacity), in a decentralised network, rather than the more traditional centralised systems. This fits with findings from individual sectors (e.g. energy supply and water supply) where decentralised are increasingly encourages, with waste- and by-products cascading down through a system [TODO: provide reference].

[TODO: summarise and explain other key findings]

Having contributed this new tool, we recognise that given the early nature of this work, there is further work which can help make this tool more usable in the real world. Firstly, more data can be contributed to the @Ravalde2016 database (e.g. process costs, appropriate to specific locations and currencies). Secondly, the model formulation can be made more sophisticated, perhaps introducing separate categories of technologies which distinguish between domestic and non-domestic technologies, and introducing storage technologies [@Keirstead2013, equations 9.3--9.10, pp166--170]. It could also incorporate 'hierarchical non-uniform time discretization' which is a sophisticated way to consider the variation in resource demand over hourly, daily¸ weekly, and seasonal periods, at lower computational cost than considering continuous profile over a long period [@Keirstead2013, p161]. Another addition to the formulation could be a device's spatial footprint. [TODO -- Note to James: domestic techs, and spatial footprint are considered in the unpublished paper, but not the book chapter.]

Moving from considering the metabolic **flows**, and turning our attention to the socioeconomic **functions**, work should consider how our model can be applied within the broader socioeconomic systems. In our case study, the modeller has complete control over energy, water, and waste management sectors. While the operator of a single system (such as an energy supplier) might have such control, different resources are often managed by different actors, each seeking to maximise their own profits and incentives [TODO: reference]. Plausibly therefore, this modelling work could contribute to arguments which favour planned utilities management over free-market management, a debate ongoing anyway with the increasing interest in Smart cities [TODO: reference].

In conclusion, in an increasingly resource-constrained world which faces the combined challenges of population growth, global warming, water scarcity, and shrinking landfill capacity, cities are being hailed as the most efficient means to provide goods and services. However, to take full advantage of this, cities should exploit their co-location of processes to benefit from synergies between energy, water and waste management systems. Our model is one step further along the journey to that end.
