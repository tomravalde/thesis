# Model development

- Tat Hamlet case study.
- Benchmarking study
- Consider constructability, fidelity, and solution time

## Summary

Given the early/pioneering nature of our modelling work, We hope that this chapter has given guidance to the UM community regarding the most promising/usable/tractable methodologies, and that this is supported by our benchmark model, which can be used to help further the development of such models.
