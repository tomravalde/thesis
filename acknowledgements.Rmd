# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

This thesis was only possible with the support of a number of people and organisations.

In particular, I would like to thank my first supervisor, James Keirstead, whose insight and encouragement stimulated so much of the work here, and who was a pleasure to work for. I am also grateful to Ivan Stoianov who very kindly took over supervision part-way through the research.

My thanks goes to Imperial College, who provided funding via the EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership. Thanks also to my colleagues in the Environmental and Water Resources Engineering Section, who were a source of good humour and thoughtful insights. Thanks in particular to fellow members of the Urban Energy Systems group, especially Stefan Pfenninger.

I have benefited from the wider academic community, including Chris Kennedy (University of Victoria) who provided the urban metabolism dataset used in Chapter \ref{sec:metrics}, and Yingru Zhao and her team (Xiamen University) who provided the case study for Chapter \ref{sec:case-study} and who generously hosted me for a week in China.

The online community more generally have shaped this thesis profoundly, especially with regards to producing 'reproducible research' -- thank you to all those who have promoted opensource data and tools, and to the community of R-users and developers.

Finally, thank you to my friends, my church, and most of all, my parents, for their encouragement, without which this would not have been possible.
