# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

The completion of this thesis was only possible with the support of many people.

In particular, I would like to thank my first supervisor, James Keirstead, whose insight and encouragement stimulated so much of the work here. I am indebted too to Ivan Stoianov who very kindly took over supervision part-way through the research. I am grateful too for Prof. Geoffrey Levermore and Dr Christian Onof for their helpful feedback during the viva voce.

Imperial College have supported me by providing both funding (via the EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership) and a superb set of friends and colleagues (both academic and administrative). I would like to thank those in the Environmental and Water Resources Engineering Section, particularly my fellow members of the Urban Energy Systems group, and especially Stefan Pfenninger. Others in the Department have provided both their technical expertise and their friendship, in particular, Craig Buchanan, Mark Bruggemann, Li Ma and Karl Smith.

I owe much to the wider academic community, including Prof. Chris Kennedy (University of Victoria) who provided the urban metabolism dataset used in Chapter \ref{sec:metrics}, and Dr Yingru Zhao and her team (Xiamen University) who provided the case study for Chapter \ref{sec:case-study} and who generously hosted me for a week in China. The data for this case study was provided by the Shaan Gu Power Company Limited. I would also like to acknowledge Dr Nouri Samsatli for developing the urban energy systems formulation on which the model developed in Chapter \ref{sec:model-dev} was based, and to thank him for sharing that model's code. The online community more generally have also shaped this thesis, and I have enjoyed joining those who advocate for reproducible research and open source data and tools.

Finally, thank you to my friends from Imperial College and Christ Church Kensington, and to all others who have supported me along the way, and most of all, my parents.
