notes: "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987112000400: Assuming a groundwater depth of 22 m used in the Elec = mgh formula; recharge as 150 mm/yr (taking the median from Fig. 9) = 4.8e-9 m/s, assume recharge area of 10 km2 = 1e7 m2, then rate = 4.8e-9 x 1e7 = 0.048 m3/s (assume small seasonal variations)"
