abstract = {The vision of Cities as forces for good within the environment is explored herein by proposing a multi-sectoral analysis that accounts for nutrients, water, energy. The main purpose is to identify those elements in the urban system that can offer more opportunities of improvement with regard to ecoefficiency and eco-effectiveness indicators, and how different sectors, i.e. water, food, forestry, energy, and waste management, interact between each other. For this, (i) a computational model is designed using concepts of Substance Flow Analysis (SFA) together with mass and energy balances, and (ii) a set of indicators are defined to assess the improvement or worsening of the system. (iii) Both model and indicators are simulated under the Regionalized Sensitivity Analysis (RSA) framework to account of uncertainty and test the relevance of prospective technological innovations, i.e. structural changes. The paper presents a case study based on the Upper Chattahoochee Watershed in the south-eastern United States, in which the nitrogen (N) cycle is investigated under two scenarios: 0{\%} and 100{\%} urine source separation implementation. Results reveal that animal feed and fossil fuels are the major flows of N in the system. Urine separation showed to be critical for some aspects of the system as described by the behavior of the set of indicators. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to the evaluation of energy conversion processes and systems, based on an extended representation of their exergy flow diagram. This approach is a systematic attempt to integrate into a unified coherent formalism both Cumulative Exergy Consumption and Thermo-economic methods, and constitutes a generalisation of both, in that its framework allows for a direct quantitative comparison of non-energetic quantities like labour and environmental impact (hence the apposition ‘Extended'). A critical examination of the existing state-of-the-art of energy- and exergy analysis methods and paradigms indicates that an extension of the existing ‘Design and Optimisation' procedures to include explicitly ‘non-energetic externalities' is indeed feasible. It appears that it can indeed be successfully argued that some of the issues that are difficult to address with a purely monetary theory of value can be resolved by Extended Exergy Accounting (‘EEA' in the following) methods without introducing arbitrary assumptions external to the theory. In this respect, EEA can be regarded as a natural development of the economic theory of production of commodities, which it extends by properly accounting for the unavoidable energy dissipation in the productive chain. While a systematic description of the EEA theory is discussed in previous work by the same author, the present paper aims at a more specific target, and presents a formal representation of the application of EEA to a cogenerating plant based on a gas turbine process. It is shown that the solution indeed leads to an ‘optimal' design, and that its formalism embeds even extended Thermo-economic formulations.},

abstract = {Urban metabolism research faces difficulties defining ecological trophic levels and analyzing relationships among the metabolic system's energy components. Here, we propose a new way to perform such research. By integrating throughflow analysis with ecological network utility analysis, we used network flows to analyze the metabolic system's network structure and the ecological relationships within the system. We developed an ecological network model for the system, and used four Chinese cities as examples of how this approach provides insights into the flows within the system at both high and low levels of detail. Using the weight distribution in the network flow matrix, we determined the structure of the urban energy metabolic system and the trophic levels; using the sign distribution in the network utility matrix, we determined the relationships between each pair of the system's compartments and their degrees of mutualism. The model uses compartments based on 17 sectors (energy exploitation; coal-fired power; heat supply; washed coal; coking; oil refinery; gas generation; coal products; agricultural; industrial; construction; communication, storage, and postal service; wholesale, retail, accommodation, and catering; household; other consuming; recovery; and energy stocks). Analyzing the structure and functioning of the urban energy metabolic system revealed ways to optimize its structure by adjusting the relationships among compartments, thereby demonstrating how ecological network analysis can be used in future urban system research. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The urbanisation process has exceeded the traditional pace of human settlement and is moving towards the formation of large urban regions in response to an increasing demand for services and environmental goods, combined with increasing production of waste and emissions. Therefore, it is fundamental to determine resource flows into cities, especially in developing countries, as well as the transformations that occur and the outputs that are produced, such as products, services and wastes. In this study, we apply urban material flow analysis, which determines the flows of inputs (water, energy, food and others) and outputs (wastewater, air pollution, wastes and others) to the city of Bogot{\'{a}}, Colombia to determine the relationship between demand for resources and the environmental impact of outputs. Quantitative and qualitative data for Bogot{\'{a}} are used to assess and compare the material and energy flow trends for this city. The results indicate that in this city, inputs and outputs are directly and linearly related. Consumption of energy and construction materials has increased, whereas food and water consumption have remained steady. Levels of recycling and sewage treatment are low, and emissions such as particulate matter have decreased. The findings from this study can be used to formulate and apply policies and strategies to improve the sustainability of resources, decrease the reliance on physical resources, increase the efficiency of resource and energy use in urban areas, and enhance sustainable production and consumption in cities. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The main findings of the project were:  The population of Greater London in 2000 was 7.4 million.  Londoners consumed 154,400 GigaWatt hours (GWh) of energy (or 13,276,000 tonnes of oil equivalent), which produced 41 million tonnes of CO2.  Londoners consumed 49 million tonnes of materials. On a per capita basis, this represents 6.7 tonnes.  27.8 million tonnes of materials were used by the construction sector.  26 million tonnes of waste was generated, of which 15 million tonnes was generated by the construction and demolition sector, 7.9 million tonnes by the commercial and industrial sector and 3.4 million tonnes by households.  6.9 million tonnes of food was consumed, of which 81{\%} was imported from outside the UK.  Londoners travelled 64 billion passengerkilometres (pass-km), of which 69{\%} was by car.  Water consumption reached 876,000,000,000 litres, of which 28{\%} was leakage. The ecological footprint of Londoners was 49 million global hectares (gha), which was 42 times its biocapacity and 293 times its geographical area. This is twice the size of the UK, and roughly the same size as Spain.  The ecological footprint per London resident was 6.63 gha. This compares with the UK average ecological footprint of 6.3 gha, and exceeds the global 'earthshare' of 2.18 gha.  The ecological footprint of London tourists was estimated at 2.4 million gha, which equates to an additional 0.32 gha per Londoner.  The predicted 'earthshare' in 2050 is estimated at 1.44 gha per capita. For Londoners to be ecologically sustainable by 2050, a 35{\%} reduction by 2020 and an 80{\%} reduction by 2050, of their ecological footprint will be needed.  Ranges of 'business as usual' and 'evolutionary' scenarios were prepared to reflect current practice and existing improvement targets. 'Revolutionary' scenarios were prepared to demonstrate that a combination of technological and behavioural changes could achieve interim sustainability targets for 2010},

abstract = {With the rapid urbanization, many cities are facing various environmental issues, resulting in local ecological degradation. It is critical to conduct a scientific assessment so that appropriate solutions can be found by considering the local realities. Many evaluation methods, such as emergy analysis, material flow analysis, data envelopment analysis and ecological footprint analysis, have been proposed. Among them, ecological footprint analysis has been applied as a useful policy and planning tool for evaluating urban sustainability. The aim of this paper is to evaluate two industrial cities by using ecological footprint method in Shenyang, China and Kawasaki, Japan. The two cities have been "friendship cities" for over 30 years and have similar industrial structures. In order to present a holistic evolution picture on their ecological footprints, we collected all the relevant data for the period of 1997-2009. The results show that Shenyang's ecological footprints experienced a significant increase, while such figures in Kawasaki were quite stable, but per capita figures in Shenyang were much less than those in Kawasaki, indicating that a gap between the two cities still exist. In order to further improve its sustainable development, Shenyang should closely collaborate with Kawasaki, learning Kawasaki's eco-town experiences and other environmental management experiences. In addition, Shenyang should also learn from other leading cities and try to optimize its industrial and energy structure and improve their citizens' environmental awareness so that it can move toward a more sustainable development direction. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A comprehensive case study is conducted in Balcova geothermal district heating system (BGDHS) in Izmir, Turkey and actual thermal data are collected and employed for analysis. Using actual system data, an assessment of the district heating system performance, energy and exergy efficiencies, and exergy destructions in the system is conducted in this regard. The exergy destructions in the overall BGDHS are quantified and illustrated using exergy flow diagram. Furthermore, both energy and exergy flow diagrams are exhibited for comparison purposes. It is observed through analysis that the exergy destructions in the system particularly take place as the exergy of the fluid lost in the pumps, the heat exchanger losses, the exergy of the thermal water (geothermal fluid) reinjected and the natural direct discharge (hot water distribution losses) of the system, accounting for 1.64{\%}, 8.57{\%}, 14.84{\%} and 28.96{\%}, respectively, of the total exergy input to the BGDHS.

During the past 20 years, Macao has experienced an economic boom accompanied by rapid social development, in which the gambling industry and related tourism services have become the main economic activity. This paper employs emergy flow analysis to investigate and characterize the evolution and development of Macao from 1983 to 2003. In addition, Macao has experienced six periods of land reclamation since 1866, supported by large-scale importation of sand and rocks from China. By simulating the emergy trends using the STELLA dynamic modeling software, we predicted the evolution of Macao's development and trends in the coming 20 years. In 2025, the city's economy is estimated to be 15 times its current size as a result of Macao's territorial expansion.

Energy and exergy analyses are conducted, and their respective efficiencies are determined for the whole systems and their components. These efficiencies are then compared for performance assessment and cleaner production. Improvement potentials for every system component and the overall system are calculated and compared. Four performance-related parameters, namely energetic renewability rate, exergetic renewability rate, system energetic reinjection rate and system exergetic reinjection rate are investigated.

On the basis of the driving force−pressure−state−response (DPSR) model and using material flow analysis, this article proposes a framework for sustainable urban management and policy assessment. A case study city in China, Suzhou, illustrates this framework. The results show that resource consumption (excluding water), water consumption, and waste generation (excluding carbon dioxide) in Suzhou after implementation of proposed policies will be 14{\%} lower than 2005 levels, 4.5{\%} higher, and 28.9{\%} higher, respectively, in 2015. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Suzhou will increase by 71.0{\%} in 2015 over 2005 levels, whereas carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product) will decrease by 44.9{\%}. Future pollution control in Suzhou should pay more attention to pollution from vehicles. In addition, goals for relative dematerialization of energy and decarbonization in Suzhou will be achieved before absolute ones are. In the short term, the urban metabolism of Suzhou in 2015 may meet corresponding urban objectives. In the longer term, however, reducing the city's resource demand and waste generation will pose challenges for the sustainability of Suzhou.},

@article{Haberl2001,
abstract = {Based upon the currently emerging international consensus on how to account for the materials flows of industrialized countries, this article proposes methods to account for the energetic metabolism of societies. It argues that, to fully exploit the potential of the metabolism approach in the context of sustainable development, both energetic and material aspects of societal metabolism have to be taken into account. The article proposes concepts to empirically describe energy input, internal energy transformations, and energy utilization of societies by extending commonly used notions of energy statistics in a way that is compatible with current methods of materials flow analysis. Whereas energy statistics include only the energy used in technical devices for providing heat, light, mechanical work, and data processing, an accounting system for the energetic metabolism of societies should also consider flows of nutritional energy for both livestock and humans. Moreover, in assessing the energy input of a society, all inputs of energy-rich materials (and immaterial forms of energy such as electricity and light) that cross the boundary into the biophysical structures of society should be taken into consideration, regardless of the purpose for which they are eventually used. As a consequence, an energetic metabolism accounting system treats all biomass as energy input, instead of considering only the biomass used for technical energy generation, as energy statistics do. Part II in this set of articles will apply these concepts to different modes of societal organization and explore the significance of energetic metabolism for sustainable development. In particular, it will explore the significance for policies that aim at increasing the contribution of renewable energy, especially biomass.},

abstract = {Bringing about more sustainable consumption patterns is an important challenge for society and science. In this article the concept of household metabolism is applied to analyzing consumption patterns and to identifying possibilities for the development of sustainable household consumption patterns. Household metabolism is determined in terms of total energy requirements, including both direct and indirect energy requirements, using a hybrid method. This method enables us to evaluate various determinants of the environmental load of consumption consistently at several levels—the national level, the local level, and the household level. The average annual energy requirement of households varies considerably between the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Sweden, as well as within these countries. The average expenditure level per household explains a large part of the observed variations. Differences between these countries are also related to the efficiency of the production sectors and to the energy supply system. The consumption categories of food, transport, and recreation show the largest contributions to the environmental load. A comparison of consumer groups with different household characteristics shows remarkable differences in the division of spending over the consumption categories. Thus, analyses of different types of households are important for providing a basis for options to induce decreases of the environmental load of household consumption. At the city level, options for change are provided by an analysis of the city infrastructure, which determines a large part of the direct energy use by households (for transport and heating). At the national level, energy efficiency in production and in electricity generation is an important trigger for decreasing household energy requirements.},

abstract = {As the world urbanizes, the role of cities in determining sustainability outcomes grows in importance. Cities are the dominant form of human habitat, and most of the world's resources are either directly or indirectly consumed in cities. Sustainable city analysis and management requires understanding the demands a city places on a wider geographical area and its ecological resource base. We present a detailed, integrated urban metabolism of residential consumption and ecological footprint analysis of the Vancouver metropolitan region for the year 2006. Our overall goal is to demonstrate the application of a bottom-up ecological footprint analysis using an urban metabolism framework at a metropolitan, regional scale. Our specific objectives are: a) to quantify energy and material consumption using locally generated data and b) to relate these data to global ecological carrying capacity. Although water is the largest material flow through Metro Vancouver (424,860,000m3), it has the smallest ecological footprint (23,100gha). Food (2,636,850 tonnes) contributes the largest component to the ecological footprint (4,514,400gha) which includes crop and grazing land as well as carbon sinks required to sequester emissions from food production and distribution. Transportation fuels (3,339,000m3) associated with motor vehicle operation and passenger air travel comprises the second largest material flow through the region and the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions (7,577,000 tonnes). Transportation also accounts for the second largest component of the EF (2,323,200gha). Buildings account for the largest electricity flow (17,515,150MWh) and constitute the third largest component of the EF (1,779,240gha). Consumables (2,400,000 tonnes) comprise the fourth largest component of the EF (1,414,440gha). Metro Vancouver's total Ecological Footprint in 2006 was 10,071,670gha, an area approximately 36 times larger than the region itself. The EFA reveals that cropland and carbon sinks (forested land required to sequester carbon dioxide emissions) account for 90{\%} of Metro Vancouver's overall demand for biocapacity. The per capita ecological footprint is 4.76gha, nearly three times the per capita global supply of biocapacity. Note that this value excludes national government services that operate outside the region and could account for up to an additional 2gha/ca. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We present the concept of sociometabolic regimes and use it to analyze patterns of change in global social metabolism. Sociometabolic regimes represent dynamic equilibria of society2013nature interactions and are characterized by typical patterns of material and energy flows (metabolic profiles). From this perspective, industrialization appears as a process of transition from the agrarian to the industrial regime. This article presents a global data set on the socioeconomic metabolism of 175 nations for the year 2000. We group the countries into six clusters differentiated by economic development and population density, reflecting the historical path of (agrarian) development and resource endowment. Our analysis reveals that per capita material and energy use in industrialized clusters is higher than in developing regions by a factor of 5 to 10. However, per capita use of natural resources differs significantly among industrialized clusters. A large fraction of the global population displays a metabolic profile somewhere in between the patterns typical for the agrarian and the industrial regimes. The sociometabolic transition from an agrarian to an industrial regime is thus an ongoing process with important consequences for future global material and energy demand. If we take a transition between regimes and the current characteristics of this transition as given, the global energy and materials demand is likely to grow by a factor of 2 to 3 during the coming decades. The most critical part of our findings relates to the cluster of high-density developing countries, as these countries already have a higher anthropogenic material and energy burden per unit of land area than, for example, industrial Europe, with pending further increases bound to surpass carrying capacities.},

abstract = {Using the city of Toronto as a case study, this article examines impacts of energy stocks and flexible demand in the urban metabolism on the resilience of the city, including discussion of directions for further study of the resiliency of the urban metabolism. An important element developed is the nominal residence time of the energy stocks. This value defines how long an energy stock lasts under typical patterns of energy use. The findings suggest that the residence times of many sources of energy overcome vulnerability when energy supply shocks last on the order of hours or a few days, but that the measure is limited to assessing only certain types of commonly used energy sources in aggregate terms. Discussion is included on the uncertainty of this measure and on the metabolic and resiliency implications of new technologies intended to reduce energy use and improve sustainability of cities and the use of the urban metabolism as a means of comparison. The methodology employed highlights how waste energy could be used to increase the resiliency of the city's water supply, but also how the study of the urban metabolism would benefit from a more disaggregate form in the study of sustainable and resilient cities.},

The objective of this study is to develop a mathematical model to integrate and optimize urban water infrastructures for supply-side planning and policy: freshwater resources and treated wastewater are allocated to various water demand categories in order to reduce contaminants in the influents supplied for drinking water, and to reduce consumption of the water resources imported from the regions beyond a city boundary. A case study is performed to validate the proposed model. An optimal urban water system of a metropolitan city is calculated on the basis of the model and compared to the existing water system. The integration and optimization decrease (i) average concentrations of the influents supplied for drinking water, which can improve human health and hygiene; (ii) total consumption of water resources, as well as electricity, reducing overall environmental impacts; (iii) life cycle cost; and (iv) water resource dependency on other regions, improving regional water security.

abstract = {In our continued effort in reducing resource consumption, greener technologies such as rainwater harvesting could be very useful in diminishing our dependence on desalinated or treated water and the associated energy requirements. This paper applies exergy analysis and exergetic efficiency to evaluate the performance of eight different scenarios of urban rainwater harvesting systems in the Mediterranean-climate Metropolitan Area of Barcelona where water is a scarce resource. A life cycle approach is taken, where the production, use, and end-of-life stages of these rainwater harvesting systems are quantified in terms of energy and material requirements in order to produce 1 m3 of rainwater per year for laundry purposes. The results show that the highest exergy input is associated with the energy uses, namely the transport of the materials to construct the rainwater harvesting systems. The scenario with the highest exergetic efficiency considers a 24 household building with a 21 m3 rainwater storage tank installed below roof. Exergy requirements could be minimized by material substitution, minimizing weight or distance traveled. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The non-linear, unexpected and severe responses of ecosystems to the environmental changes crossing ecological thresholds or environmental limits, necessitate the regular monitoring of the human-induced pressures to the urban ecosystems. The present study aims to introduce a spatial decision support system for sustainable environmental planning and management of urban ecosystems by establishing an Urban Carrying Capacity Load Number model (UCCLN) based on carrying capacity concepts and sustainability principles.This model, by applying 30 temporal and spatial indicators continuously monitors the environmental loads on the urban ecosystems. Environmental load was represented by load number index. It was calculated in each zone of study area (urban districts). Geographical Information System (GIS) was used to establish UCCLN model and Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS). The study area was Tehran metropolis, the capital of Iran. The results showed that none of the 115 urban districts of Tehran had optimal Total Load Number (TLN) ranging from (10 to100); 7 districts (6{\%}) had low-to-medium range of TLN (TLN = 100-200); 11 districts (9.5{\%}) had medium-to-high range (TLN = 200-300); 57 districts (49.5{\%}) had high-to-very high range (TLN = 300-400); 40 districts (34.7{\%}) had the TLN range of very high-to-critical (TLN = 400-500); and none of them had the TLN of 500. Furthermore, the results revealed that Tehran has already overshot its ecological thresholds. Not only most of the 30 indicators of environmental pressure in most of the districts (85{\%}) had high DCC and LN scores, but also most of the 115 districts obtained high DCC, and as a result LN scores. The need for developing more efficient urban planning and management strategies to cope with the increasing environmental loads in the study area is inevitable. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An evaluation of interlinkages and synergies among the different resources and performance patterns in the city of Rome (Italy) was accomplished by means of decomposition equations, in order to identify the major drivers of change in the investigated period as well as future low-resource scenarios. A half-a-century historical series (1962-2008) of energy and resource consumption in the city of Rome (Italy) was investigated in order to ascertain the links between resource use and complexity change. Environmental, material and energy inputs were firstly evaluated as actual energy and mass flows, then converted to emergy units to provide an assessment on a common ground. Results show that the sustainability of the urban system decreased steadily in the investigated period, as confirmed by both intensive and extensive parameters. The demand for abiotic matter, water, energy and emergy (environmental work) was accounted for over time and referred to the population (per-capita indicators) and current prices economic product generated by the city (GVA, Gross Value Added). Moreover, the effects associated with the emissions were evaluated, with a special focus on global warming and acidification potential. The changes in the urban metabolism occurred within the investigated period were analyzed considering the variation of different inputs necessary to drive the city (electricity, fuels, goods, machineries, etc.). Finally, a decomposition analysis was performed to identify the main causes and drivers associated with the changes in the city metabolism. Decomposition results show that the increased fraction of imports compared to local sources, of non-renewable resources compared to renewables, as well as of population and per capita income not accompanied by sufficient increase of energy and material efficiency are the major drivers of such unsustainability pattern and call for policies that focus on optimization of production and consumption patterns in times of unavoidable shrinking of resource basis.},

In this collector, the absorber plate-container unit performs the function of both absorbing the solar energy and storing PCM. The solar energy was stored in paraffin wax, which was used as a PCM, and was discharged to cold water flowing in pipes located inside the wax. The collector's effective area was assumed to be 1 m2 and its total volume was divided into 5 sectors. The experimental apparatus was designed to simulate one of the collector's sectors, with an apparatus-absorber effective area of 0.2 m2. Outdoor experiments were carried out to demonstrate the applicability of using a compact solar collector for water heating. The time-wise temperatures of the PCM were recorded during the processes of charging and discharging. The solar intensity was recorded during the charging process. Experiments were conducted for different water flow rates of 8.3-21.7 kg/h. The effect of the water flow rate on the useful heat gain (Qu) was studied. The heat transfer coefficients were calculated for the charging process. The propagation of the melting and freezing front was also studied during the charging and discharging processes. The experimental results showed that in the charging process, the average heat transfer coefficient increases sharply with increasing the molten layer thickness, as the natural convection grows strong. In the discharge process, the useful heat gain was found to increase as the water mass flow rate increases. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Analysis of the structure and function of urban metabolic systems is an important goal of urban research. We used network pathways and network utility analysis to analyze the basic network structure of the urban metabolic system and the complex ecological relationships within the system, providing a new way to perform such research. Using four Chinese cities as examples, we developed an ecological network model of the urban metabolic system. By using network pathway analysis, we studied the changing relationships between metabolic length and the number of metabolic pathways, and between metabolic length and reachability. Based on the distribution of the number of metabolic pathways, we describe the basic structure and intercompartment relationships of the system. By using the sign distribution in the network utility matrix, we determined the ecological relationships and degree of mutualism between the compartments of the system. The basic components of the system consisted of the internal environment, the external environment, and the agricultural, industrial, and domestic sectors. With increasing metabolic length, the ecological relationships among the components of the system became more diverse, and the numbers of metabolic paths and their reachability improved. Although the basic network structure of the four cities was identical, the mutualism index differed. Beijing's mutualism index was superior to that of Shanghai, and much higher than those of Tianjin and Chongqing. By analyzing the structure and function of the urban metabolic system, we provide suggestions for optimizing the structure and adjusting the relationships, and propose methods for the application of ecological network analysis in future urban system research.

Using the Eurostat method, the study was conducted for the year 2003 and for three regional levels: Paris, Paris and its suburbs, and the entire region. Applying the method on a local scale required two local indicators to be defined in order to take into account the impact of exported wastes on MFA: LEPO, local and exported flows to nature, and DMCcorr, a modified domestic material consumption (DMC) that excludes exported wastes (and imported ones if necessary). As the region extracts, produces, and transforms less material than the country as a whole, its direct material input (DMI) is lower than the national DMI. In all the areas, LEPO exceeds 50{\%} of DMI; in contrast, recycling is very low. The multiscale approach reveals that urban metabolism is strongly impacted by density and the distribution of activities: the dense city center (Paris) exports all of its wastes to the other parts of the region and concentrates food consumption, whereas the agricultural and urban sprawl area consumes high levels of construction materials and fuel. This supports the use of MFA on an urban and regional scale as a basis for material flow management and dematerialization strategies and clearly reveals the important interactions between urban and regional planning and development, and material flows.

abstract = {The thermodynamic interpretation of ecosystem evolution introduced in Part 1 of this series provides a basis for quantitative analysis of strategies for reducing resource depletion. In Part 2, we express resource depletion rate as a product of consumption rate and the Depletion number (Dp)—a non-dimensional indicator of depletion per unit consumption. We introduce two generalized models of resource use that incorporate a choice between virgin resource extraction and post-consumption resource recycling. These models are used as a basis for expressing Dp as a function of non-dimensional indicators for three resource conservation strategies: exergy cycling fraction ($\psi$) for resource recycling, exergy efficiency ($\phi$) for process efficiency gains, and renewed exergy fraction ($\Omega$) for extent of renewed resource use. We use the resulting expressions to fully characterize strategy interaction, strategy limitations, and the roles that these strategies play in allowing resource consumption to occur with decreasing levels of resource depletion. We also show how the derived framework may be incorporated into an economic analysis to identify least-cost approaches to depletion avoidance in a toluene production and cycling system.},

abstract = {This study presents a mathematical programming formulation for the design of water and heat exchangers networks based on a two-step methodology. First, an MILP (mixed integer linear programming) procedure is used to solve the water and energy allocation problem regarding several objectives. The first step of the design method involves four criteria to be taken into account., ie, fresh water consumption (F 
                        1), energy consumption (F 
                        2), interconnection number (F 
                        3) and number of heat exchangers (F 
                        4). The multiobjective optimization Min [F 
                        1, F 
                        2] is solved by the so-called $\epsilon$-constraint method and leads to several Pareto fronts for fixed numbers of connections and heat exchangers. The second step consists in improving the best results of the first phase with energy integration into the water network. This stage is solved by an MINLP procedure in order to minimize an objective cost function. Two examples reported in the dedicated literature serve as test bench cases to apply the proposed two-step approach. The results show that the simultaneous consideration of the abovementioned objectives is more realistic than the only minimization of fresh water consumption. Indeed, the optimal network does not necessarily correspond to the structure that reaches the fresh water target. For a real paper mill plant, energy consumption decreases of almost 20{\%} as compared with previous studies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper is providing a design and evaluation methodology for biomass utilization networks (B-NETs) planning in local areas. The methodology is an effort to integrate various exertions of many researchers as well as stakeholders in the biomass field including process technologies, local area classification and renewable energy mechanisms to design and evaluate B-NETs. The proposed design methodology has three steps: classification, problem formulation and suggesting solution methods. The core part of planning the B-NETs utilization methodology is the superstructure that is a super class model for the processes of biomass utilization networks that has to be built for the local area. The biomass utilization superstructure (BUSS) relates the biomass resources to their products, available processes, and possible future processes of utilization in static manner. Although the local area BUSS is static in nature, it shows the decision makers what kinds of B-NETs are, or can be, available in their area. It is important to note that for each super class process there exists a number of elemental technologies, or what we call unit process (UP), that can perform the job under the same condition with different processing constraint. To support the design and operation process a technological information infrastructure (TII) needs to be built to work as an information pool and simulation tool. With the support of TII and the BUSS different scenarios can be synthesized, analyzed and compared. Scenarios development enables the designer to check processing alternatives as well as biomass promotion mechanisms that fit the concerns of various stakeholders. The results of the methodology application can be given in the form of suggestions of a specific network class(es) or scenarios that can be applied in a class of localities with the same characteristics. Following to methodology configuration, a proposal for optimization methods is discussed and a case study for comparing biomass network scenarios in mountainous city is introduced. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The integrated study of energy and urban systems has recently become a critical component of sustainability research and policy. Increasing urbanization of human societies combined with intense energy demands of modern economies have driven a recognition that sustainable practices require a systems approach to both the study and application of sustainability principles. Urban metabolism has emerged as a leading methodology for quantifying energy consumption and use patterns in urban environments. Though typically applied as a method of accounting for total energy and materials inputs and outputs into cities, its interdisciplinary history and methods allow urban metabolism to be expanded in ways that will allow more comprehensive and integrated assessment of the patterns and processes of urban energy systems. In this article, we review the concept of urban metabolism-including its two typical approaches: mass balance and "emergy" methods-and offer a means to expand urban metabolism into a platform that incorporates socioeconomic analysis, policy analysis, and additional quantitative methodologies (such as life cycle assessment). This expanded urban metabolism framework is more comprehensive analytically and builds upon the documented capacity of traditional urban metabolism to account for total energy and materials flows of cities to provide an integrated platform for analysis of both energy patterns and the causal processes that govern energy in contemporary cities. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper presented a thermodynamic synthesis that involved resource accounting, evaluation and modeling of urban ecosystems based on embodied cosmic exergy (EcE), which redefined embodied exergy with the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) as the reference for solar exergy. In a case study of the Beijing urban ecosystem, the major resources supporting the urban ecosystem, both from free natural resources and from the economy, were accounted for, analyzed and evaluated in the same units, Cosmic Joules (Jc). These indicators revealed the current performance of the Beijing urban ecosystem by considering five aspects of the system: EcE sources, EcE intensity, EcE welfare, environmental impacts and economic efficiency. Moreover, through the combination of the EcE synthesis with a systems dynamics, this research constructed an embodied cosmic exergy-based urban system model (EESM) using Beijing as an example of urban development. The results show that the 10 years from 2010 to 2020 will be very critical for the sustainable development of Beijing because many key factors, such as water resources, wastes and urban assets, might be confronted with great changes during this period. These changes will inevitably transform the urban system not only in its external circumstances but also in its inner structure and may lead to serious consequences. Of all the necessary resources, the most sensitive factor is water supply. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Without a theory of value (price) in ecological economics, the valuation of ecosystem and economic resources cannot be rigorously defended. At the crux of the matter is the 'valuation' or 'mixed units' problem of commensurating biophysical inputs/outputs which are different. This paper critically reviews candidate theories of value which have emerged in the ecological economics literature for dealing with this problem. First of all, the Neo-Ricardian emerged, using Sraffa-type systems is discussed. In particular, Judson's assertion that the Sraffa system is suitable for ecological economics is questioned, as it is based on 'circular flow', generation of a 'surplus' and 'exchange values'. None of these ideas are consistent with a biophysical catheterisation of an economic system, which is paramount in ecological economics. A more fruitful avenue for establishing a biophysical theory of value based on ecological and thermodynamic principles, is to extend Patterson's quality equivalent methodology (QEM) to explicitly include mass flows in addition to energy. At this point a model close to Costanza and Hannon's biosphere model of price determination emerges. The extended QEM model however, has a number of important advantages over the Costanza-Hannon model because it has a more generalised formulation and is not reliant on necessarily using solar energy as the numeraire. The paper concludes with a discussion of some outstanding issues that need to be resolved before a biophysical theory of value can be properly established in ecological economics.},

In this paper, we look particularly at models relevant to national and international energy policy, grouping them into four categories: energy systems optimization models, energy systems simulation models, power systems and electricity market models, and qualitative and mixed-methods scenarios. We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities. In discussing these challenges, we present possible avenues for future research and make recommendations to ensure the continued relevance for energy systems models as important sources of information for policy-making. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper aims to measure raw material inputs and waste flows in an Irish city-region in order to analyse (i) whether there was absolute dematerialisation in the particular case study over the period 1992-2002 and (ii) whether material consumption and waste generation were decoupled from economic growth and increases in disposable income over the same period. It was found that the selected material flow indicators showed no evidence of absolute dematerialisation over the given study period, although more recent evidence at the national level suggests that a decline in construction activity and extraction of non-metallic minerals has resulted in an absolute reduction in material consumption and it is likely that this will be mirrored at the system boundary level. It was found that Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) per capita and Direct Material Input (DMI) per capita increased at a faster rate than Domestic Processed Output (DPO) per capita and Direct Material Output (DMO) per capita between 1992 and 2002, which indicates relative decoupling of consumption from waste generation. In addition, it was found that there was relative decoupling of consumption and waste generation from disposable income growth over the study period. Finally, it was found that average DMC and DMI figures for the selected case study were lower than the national averages but broadly similar to results for other city-regions in the European Union (EU). On a methodological note, it was concluded that material flow accounting (MFA) for city-regions in Ireland is constrained due to a lack of disaggregated data for material flows, with the exception of local waste data, and it is recommended that bottom-up analysis should be used to complement disaggregated top-down data. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper reports on an integration of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and inexact mixed integer linear programming (IMILP) methods to support selection of an optimal landfill site and a waste-flow-allocation pattern such that the total system cost can be minimized. Selection of a landfill site involves both qualitative and quantitative criteria and heuristics. In order to select the best landfill location, it is often necessary to compromise among possibly conflicting tangible and intangible factors. Different multi-objective programming models have been proposed to solve the problem. A weakness with the different multi-objective programming models used to solve the problem is that they are basically mathematical and ignore qualitative and often subjective considerations such as the risk of groundwater pollution as well as other environmental and socio-economic factors which are important in landfill selection. The selection problem also involves a change in allocation pattern of waste-flows required by construction of a new landfill. A waste flow refers to the routine of transferring waste from one location in a city to another. In selection of landfill locations, decision makers need to consider both the potential sites that should be used as well as the allocation pattern of the waste-flow at different periods of time. This paper reports on our findings in applying an integrated IMILP/MCDA approach for solving the solid waste management problem in a prairie city. The five MCDA methods of simple weighted addition, weighted product, co-operative game theory, TOPSIS, and complementary ELECTRE are adopted to evaluate the landfill site alternatives considered in the solid waste management problem, and results from the evaluation process are presented. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Sustainability is rapidly moving from an abstract concept to a measurable state of dynamic human-ecological systems. The large number of economic, social, and environmental indicators currently available provides an unwieldy view of system sustainability. To aid policy decisions, these indicators are therefore either presented in the context of a conceptual framework, or quantitatively aggregated into indices. Due to the quantitative nature of sustainability indices, their results may be given more weight by scientists and policy-makers. However, policy decisions can be ineffective or even counterproductive if they do not consider factors which influence index behavior: the scale of the available data and choice of system boundaries; the inclusion, transformation, and weighting of indicator data; and the aggregation method used. As previous reviews have demonstrated, sustainability indices do not rank countries consistently, even when using some of the same indicator data. Several improvements would increase the utility of sustainability indices for policy decisions, particularly the identification of biases introduced by the index methodology and data inclusion. The discrepancy of current sustainability indices due to theoretical or methodological differences supports the use of several complementary indices. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Virtual water as the overall water consumption of a building includes not only the on-site water use for constructing and operating, but also the off-site water used to supply the necessary manpower, material and equipment inputs required by the building. This paper advances a systematic virtual water accounting framework for building by employing a hybrid method as the combination of both process and input-output analysis. Based on the raw project data in the Bill of Quantities, a detailed case study is performed for the structure engineering of six landmark buildings in E-town, Beijing, supported by the virtual water intensity database for the Chinese economy in 2007. The total virtual water of the case buildings is quantified as 1.25E+06 m3, corresponding to an intensity of 20.83 m3 per square meter floor area. On-site tap-water supply, material inputs and manpower inputs contribute to 43.55{\%}, 50.05{\%} and 6.31{\%} of the virtual water, respectively, indicating the fact that off-site water use plays a critical role in balancing the overall water budget of a building. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Urbanmetabolism studies have been established for only a few cities worldwide, and difficulties obtaining adequate statistical data are universal. Constraints and peculiarities call for inno- vative methods to quantify the materials entering and leaving city boundaries. Such methods include the extrapolation of data at the country or the region level based, namely, on sales, population, commuters, workers, and waste produced. The work described in this article offers a new methodol- ogy developed specifically for quantifying urbanmaterial flows, making possible the regular compilation of data pertinent to the characterization of a city's metabolism. This methodol- ogy was tested in a case study that characterized the urban metabolism of the city of Lisbon by quantifying Lisbon's ma- terial balance for 2004. With this aim, four variables were characterized and linked to material flows associated with the city: absolute consumption ofmaterials/products per category, throughput of materials in the urban system per material cate- gory, material intensity of economic activities, and waste flows per treatment technology. Results showthat annualmaterial consumption in Lisbon to- tals 11.223 million tonnes (20 tonnes per capita), and material outputs sum 2.149 million tonnes. Nonrenewable resources represent almost 80{\%} of the total material consumption, and renewables consumption (biomass) constitutes only 18{\%} of the total consumption. The remaining portion is made up of nonspecified materials. A seemingly excessive consumption amount of nonrenew- able materials compared to renewables may be the result of a large investment in building construction and a significant shift toward private car traveling, to the detriment of public transportation.},

abstract = {Population growth and improving standards of living, coupled with dramatically increased urbanization, are placing increased pressures on available water resources, necessitating new approaches to urban water management. The tradition linear "take, make, waste" approach to managing water increasingly is proving to be unsustainable, as it is leading to water stress (insufficient water supplies), unsustainable resource (energy and chemicals) consumption, the dispersion of nutrients into the aquatic environment (especially phosphorus), and financially unstable utilities. Different approaches are needed to achieve economic, environmental, and social sustainability. Fortunately, a toolkit consisting of stormwater management/rainwater harvesting, water conservation, water reclamation and reuse, energy management, nutrient recovery, and source separation is available to allow more closed-loop urban water and resource management systems to be developed and implemented. Water conservation and water reclamation and reuse (multiple uses) are becoming commonplace in numerous water-short locations. Decentralization, enabled by new, high-performance treatment technologies and distributed stormwater management/rainwater harvesting, is furthering this transition. Likewise, traditional approaches to residuals management are evolving, as higher levels of energy recovery are desired, and nutrient recovery and reuse is to be enhanced. A variety of factors affect selection of the optimum approach for a particular urban area, including local hydrology, available water supplies, water demands, local energy and nutrient-management situations, existing infrastructure, and utility governance structure. A proper approach to economic analysis is critical to determine the most sustainable solutions. Stove piping (i.e., separate management of drinking, storm, and waste water) within the urban water and resource management profession must be eliminated. Adoption of these new approaches to urban water and resource management can lead to more sustainable solutions, defined as financially stable, using locally sustainable water supplies, energy-neutral, providing responsible nutrient management, and with access to clean water and appropriate sanitation for all.},

abstract = {In this study, an inexact community-scale energy model (ICS-EM) has been developed for planning renewable energy management (REM) systems under uncertainty. This method is based on an integration of the existing interval linear programming (ILP), chance-constrained programming (CCP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) techniques. ICS-EM allows uncertainties presented as both probability distributions and interval values to be incorporated within a general optimization framework. It can also facilitate capacity-expansion planning for energy-production facilities within a multi-period and multi-option context. Complexities in energy management systems can be systematically reflected, thus applicability of the modeling process can be highly enhanced. The developed method has then been applied to a case of long-term renewable energy management planning for three communities. Useful solutions for the planning of energy management systems have been generated. Interval solutions associated with different risk levels of constraint violation have been obtained. They can be used for generating decision alternatives and thus help decision makers identify desired policies under various economic and system-reliability constraints. The generated solutions can also provide desired energy resource/service allocation and capacity-expansion plans with a minimized system cost, a maximized system reliability and a maximized energy security. Tradeoffs between system costs and constraint-violation risks can also be tackled. Higher costs will increase system stability, while a desire for lower system costs will run into a risk of potential instability of the management system. They are helpful for supporting (a) adjustment or justification of allocation patterns of energy resources and services, (b) formulation of local policies regarding energy consumption, economic development and energy structure, and (c) analysis of interactions among economic cost, system reliability and energy-supply security. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This issue of the Journal of Cleaner Production is based upon papers presented at the 1st International Workshop Advances in Cleaner Production (CP) held in S??o Paulo, Brazil, in 2007. The conference had the short-term purpose of deepening the Brazilian discussion on "The Roles of Cleaner Production in the Sustainable Development of Modern Societies", and it had the long-term objective of providing an on-going interdisciplinary forum for knowledge development and exchange on Cleaner Production (CP) and Sustainable Development. This issue is devoted to papers covering a broad range of perspectives of CP practices and strategies. A special focus is placed upon methodological tools designed to support effective decision-making pertaining to quantitative benefits from CP. The ten papers provide insights from research designed to holistically integrate CP to help society make effective progress to sustainability. Papers cover the importance of informal knowledge, as complementary to formal knowledge, in performing effective 'Environmental Impact Assessments.' One paper explores the roles of radical and incremental innovation in the context of alternative automotive technologies. Benefits of Ecodesign are explored in two papers; one concerning its integration with remanufacturing to extend the life of used products and one focusing the adoption of 'Emergy Environmental Accounting,' as a complementary decision-making tool. The development of the Brazilian LCI database for 'hydroelectric power generation' and its contribution to support regionally relevant LCA studies is highlighted in one paper. The complete production chains of biodiesel and bioethanol are evaluated by using global methodologies, which help in the development of more objective and effective solutions. A "compensatory area", calculated in terms of emergy, is proposed in order to work in a sustainable way for bamboo production. Finally, a paper about a novel approach for recycling used PET is also included. ?? 2009.},

abstract = {Contaminants cause a decrease in the quality of materials with each recycling step. These quality losses should be minimized to increase the sustainability of resources use. Quality losses cannot be measured using weight-based recovery definitions alone, as the quality degradation cannot be translated by mass measures. Therefore, a better measure of the efficiency of resource use is investigated in the present work. Exergy is a measure of the quality of the energy and of resources in systems. The exergy losses are a thermodynamic measure of exhaustion and thus, of the quality losses in the resource systems. We describe a method to calculate the exergy content and exergy losses of metals during recovery and recycling of a concept car. The exergy losses attributed to recycling (the pollution with other metals) and the consequent need for dilution can be used as indicators of the quality loss of materials and of the efficiency of resource use in product systems. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {With the growing environmental concern, there is evidence that increasing symbiotic relationship between plants in the same industrial area, highly contributes to a more sustainable development of industrial activities. The concept of industrial ecology extended to the terms of eco-industrial park (or ecopark) or industrial symbioses is the topic of extensive research since the five last years. More particularly, even if a lot of ecopark examples and realizations already exist throughout the world, a lot of ecopark proposals are in progress but not achieved. Recently, this vision leads the research community to focus on works proposing methods to optimize the exchanges of an ecopark prior to its design and construction. We find it especially interesting for the scientific community to propose a detailed paper review focused on optimization works devoted to the design of eco industrial parks. This paper is based on a comprehensive literature search in Web of Science database for publications that listed 'industrial symbiosis' (or 'eco industrial park', or 'inter plant integration') and 'optimization'. This study is segmented into different sections with first, a description of the different concepts evoked in the literature. Then, the several types of networking in an eco-industrial park are detailed in association with the optimization methods employed to solve each problem. The following sections reviews the different objective functions that are formulated to optimally design an eco-industrial park. The last part of the paper is devoted to a critical analysis of the state of the art by proposing several routes to improve the methodologies found in the literature. Another aim of this paper review consists in finding the gaps existing in previous studies. These major gaps are found to be: The lack of multiobjective optimization studies, the absence of social/societal objectives formulation also needs to be addressed and the lack of works taking into account flexibility of ecoparks in an operational point of view.},

Previous research on the metabolic processes for the elements that flow through eco-industrial parks has mainly accounted for the flows, stocks, and utilization efficiency of a few elements, but few studies have analyzed the complex internal characteristics of these metabolic processes by combining their structural and functional attributes. In this study, we analyzed the delivery and transformation processes and the internal characteristics of the industrial metabolic processes for sulfur in the Lubei eco-industrial park. By using network analysis, we were able to analyze the structural and functional characteristics of this network from the perspective of nodes (members of the network) and paths (flows between the nodes), and by combining an assessment of the characteristics of the nodes (degree, betweenness, closeness) and the paths (flow quantities and directions), we identified the key node (the cement clinker production), peripheral nodes (the ammonia and power plants), and key paths in the network (from the sulfuric acid plant to the ammonium phosphate plant, from the cement clinker production to the sulfuric acid plant, and from the ammonium phosphate plant to the cement clinker production). These results reveal the advantages and disadvantages of the Lubei eco-industrial park in terms of its structure and function, and suggest ways to improve the efficiency and the sustainable development of the park.},

The continuous process of matter accumulation in urban systems differs in intensity across the globe according to specific urban features, such as location and age of the urban tissue, and as a physical manifestation of metabolic lineaments, material accumulation should differ amongst cities. In this paper, a new indicator to measure this process of material accumulation is proposed, namely, the Technomass. Emulating ecology, which measures biomass in natural ecosystems, a sample of different urban tissues in a given city - Bogot?? - was measured in terms of volume and rates of matter accumulation. Technomass is able to indicate overall asymptotic behaviour, specific spatial profiles and intensification of rates in time. In metabolic terms, the indicator looks into the black box, providing the possibility to link metabolic behaviours with urban form and attempting to fill the gap between urban planning, urban metabolism (UM) and Material Flow Analysis (MFA). This new indicator offers a broad scope of applications. Further possibilities and links to urban research and policy making are explored in the discussion section. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The FP7 project BRIDGE (sustainaBle uRban plannIng Decision support accountinG for urban mEtabolism) aimed to address this gap by illustrating the advantages of considering these issues in urban planning. The BRIDGE Decision Support System (DSS) aids the evaluation of the sustainability of urban planning interventions. The Multi Criteria Analysis approach adopted provides a method to cope with the complexity of urban metabolism. In consultation with targeted end-users, objectives were defined in relation to the interactions between the environmental elements (fluxes of energy, water, carbon and pollutants) and socioeconomic components (investment costs, housing, employment, etc.) of urban sustainability. The tool was tested in five case study cities: Helsinki, Athens, London, Florence and Gliwice; and sub-models were evaluated using flux data selected. This overview of the BRIDGE project covers the methods and tools used to measure and model the physical flows, the selected set of sustainability indicators, the methodological framework for evaluating urban planning alternatives and the resulting DSS prototype. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The utilisation of fluctuating renewable energy sources is increasing world-wide; however, so is the concern about how to integrate these resources into the energy systems. The design of optimal energy resource mixes in climate change mitigation actions is a challenge faced in many places. This optimisation may be implemented according to economic objectives or with a focus on techno-operational aims and within these two main groupings, several different criteria may potentially be applied to the design process. In this article, a series of optimisation criteria are reviewed and subsequently applied to an energy system model of Western Denmark in an analysis of how to use heat pumps for the integration of wind power. The analyses demonstrate that the fact whether the system in question is modelled as operated in island mode or not has a large impact on the definition of the optimal wind power level. If energy savings and CO2 emission reductions beyond the system boundary are not included in the analysis, then it is either not feasible to expand wind power to a high degree or it is conversely more feasible to install relocation technologies that can utilise any excess production. The analyses also demonstrate that different optimisation criteria render different optimal designs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As a physical assessment of the sustainability of the China society, presented in this paper is an exergy-based systems account for resources use and environmental emissions of the China society in 2006 as the most recent year with statistics availability. Exergy analysis is applied to elucidate the resources flows from the natural environment into the society, between other countries or regions and the society, between the sectors of the society, and the emissions outflows into the natural environment from different sectors. For the China society broken down into seven sectors (i.e., extraction, conversion, agriculture, industry, transportation, tertiary and households) as one of the most complicated cases, systems account of environmental emissions as greenhouse gases and "three wastes" is carried out for the first time, combined with an updated resources account. The total societal exergy consumption amounts to 101.1 EJ, of which 93.6{\%} is due to resources use accounted as 94.6 EJ, of which 23.2{\%} is by the industry sector, 22.8{\%} by conversion, 20.4{\%} by households, 12.3{\%} by agriculture, 9.0{\%} by tertiary, 6.9{\%} by extraction and 5.4{\%} by transport, and 6.4{\%} due to environmental emissions accounted as 6481.6 PJ, including greenhouse gas emissions of 5706.1 PJ, with the highly remarkable fraction of 49.05{\%} from CH4 of the same importance as 50.91{\%} from CO2 and only 0.04{\%} from N2O, and "three wastes" emissions of only 775.5 PJ. The extraction sector is shown as the leading emitter with 32.6{\%} of the total emissions, followed by the industry with 20.0{\%}, agriculture with 17.3{\%}, and conversion sector with 16.8{\%}. To characterize the network performance in context of environmental resources from a systems ecological perspective, exergy-based ecological efficiency and resources conversion coefficient are found as 88.8{\%} and 91.3{\%} for the extraction sector, 29.0{\%} and 30.0{\%} for the conversion sector, 31.5{\%} and 33.5{\%} for the agriculture sector, 34.8{\%} and 36.1{\%} for the industry sector, 16.3{\%} and 17.3{\%} for the transportation sector, 38.4{\%} and 38.5{\%} for the tertiary sector, and only 1.3{\%} and 1.3{\%} for the households sector, respectively.

The WCA is a numerical alternative to the graphical water targeting technique known as the water surplus diagram. The WCA is to the water surplus diagram in water pinch analysis (WPA) as problem table analysis (PTA) is to the grand composite curves in heat pinch analysis. By eliminating the tedious iterative steps of the water surplus diagram, the WCA can quickly yield accurate minimum water targets, pinch point locations, and water allocation targets for a maximum water recovery (MWR) network, thereby offering a key complementary role to the water surplus diagram in the synthesis of water network. As in the case of the water surplus diagram, the WCA is not limited to mass-transfer–based operations and is applicable to a wide range of water-using operations. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 50: 3169–3183, 2004},

Like any analysis technique, the accuracy of the results is as good as the data available, but the additional challenge is that the data need to characterize an entire ecosystem's flows and storages. Thus, data requirements are substantial. As a result, there have, in fact, not been a significant number of network models constructed and development of the network analysis methodology has progressed largely within the purview of a few established models. In this paper, we outline the steps for one approach to construct network models. Lastly, we also provide a brief overview of the algorithmic methods used to construct food web typologies when empirical data are not available. It is our aim that such an effort aids other researchers to consider the construction of such models as well as encourages further refinement of this procedure. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Data from urban metabolism studies from eight metropolitan regions across five continents, conducted in various years since 1965, are assembled in consistent units and compared. Together with studies of water, materials, energy, and nutrient flows from additional cities, the comparison provides insights into the changing metabolism of cities. Most cities studied exhibit increasing per capita metabolism with respect to water, wastewater, energy, and materials, although one city showed increasing efficiency for energy and water over the 1990s. Changes in solid waste streams and air pollutant emissions are mixed. The review also identifies metabolic processes that threaten the sustainability of cities. These include altered ground water levels, exhaustion of local materials, accumulation of toxic materials, summer heat islands, and irregular accumulation of nutrients. Beyond concerns over the sheer magnitudes of resource flows into cities, an understanding of these accumulation or storage processes in the urban metabolism is critical. Growth, which is inherently part of metabolism, causes changes in water stored in urban aquifers, materials in the building stock, heat stored in the urban canopy layer, and potentially useful nutrients in urban waste dumps. Practical reasons exist for understanding urban metabolism. The vitality of cities depends on spatial relationships with surrounding hinterlands and global resource webs. Increasing metabolism implies greater loss of farmland, forests, and species diversity; plus more traffic and more pollution. Urban policy makers should consider to what extent their nearest resources are close to exhaustion and, if necessary, appropriate strategies to slow exploitation. It is apparent from this review that metabolism data have been established for only a few cities worldwide, and interpretation issues exist due to lack of common conventions. Further urban metabolism studies are required.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for evaluating investments in decentralized renewable power generation under price un certainty. The analysis is applicable for a client with an electricity load and a renewable resource that can be utilized for power generation. The investor has a deferrable opportunity to invest in one local power generating unit, with the objective to maximize the profits from the opportunity. Renewable electricity generation can serve local load when generation and load coincide in time, and surplus power can be exported to the grid. The problem is to find the price intervals and the capacity of the generator at which to invest. Results from a case with wind power generation for an office building suggests it is optimal to wait for higher prices than the net present value break-even price under price uncertainty, and that capacity choice can depend on the current market price and the price volatility. With low price volatility there can be more than one investment price interval for different units with intermediate waiting regions between them. High price volatility increases the value of the investment opportunity, and therefore makes it more attractive to postpone investment until larger units are profitable. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recycling contributes significantly to the natural resources preservation. However since recycling technology at the same time requires primary materials and energy input, both contributing to the natural resources depletion, it is important to evaluate the resource efficiency of the whole recycling chain to determine the actual benefit of recycling. For such an evaluation exergy analysis can be used by calculation of the exergy efficiency as an indicator for the resource efficiency of the recycling chain. In this paper exergy analysis is added as a metric to the fundamental recycling system optimisation model developed previously by the authors. This addition allows evaluation and optimisation of the recycling system environmental performance on a fundamental basis, capturing exergy efficiency in the system as a function of physical, metallurgical and thermal processing and the quality of recyclates. Several car recycling scenarios have been evaluated using the fundamental recycling system optimisation model. The results reveal the influence of legislatively required recycling/recovery quotas and recycling system architecture on the environmental benefits of recycling. The results suggest that legislation does not represent the best exergy and resource efficiency of the system supporting the view that the present stringent legislation for end-of-life vehicle recycling is violating fundamental thermodynamics. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically the development and testing of new modeling techniques emphasizing the network sustainability of integrated urban systems is warranted.

abstract = {The keys of studying urban sustainable development are material metabolism flux and efficiency. Metabolism flux of urban materials can only reflect the metabolism velocity, while its eco-efficiency can determine the metabolism capacity to support socio-economic development. The general model and the measure model of the eco-efficiency were set up, based on the source recycle (decreasing the consumption of crude resources) and the terminal recycle (decreasing the discharge of pollutants) of production and life. These models were employed to study material metabolism flux and efficiency in Shenzhen, China. Results showed that water, energy and waste metabolism fluxes have increased since 1998 with constant socio-economic development, and their eco-efficiencies have also increased rapidly. When GDP rose by 2.7 times, the metabolism fluxes of urban water and electricity rose by 1.5 and 3.0 times, respectively. When the added value of industry rose by 3.7 times, the metabolism fluxes of industrial water, electricity, energy and waste rose by 1.9, 3.5, 2.7 and 2.0 times, respectively. When population rose by 1.5 times, the metabolism fluxes of residential water and electricity rose by 1.8 and 1.7 times, respectively. During the period, the resource efficiency, environmental efficiency and eco-efficiency rose by 1.8, 3.7 and 2.3 times, respectively. Whereas the efficiency of material metabolism has been improved in Shenzhen, the scarcity of material resources has become more and more serious. Therefore, it is necessary to further improve the efficiency of material metabolism. The keys of improving the eco-efficiency of urban material metabolism are the increasing of resource and environmental efficiencies, and the establishing of the recycling chain of re-utilization of waste resources. ?? 2007 Ecological Society of China.},

Path numbers increase combinatorially without bound as path length increases, at much faster rates with energy storage than without. Energy flows over only very short paths in the nonstorage case, but with storage present most flow is associated with long paths. Cycling results. A cycling index modified from the literature standard to include storage shows 11{\%} cycling in the subject model. Energy does cycle in ecosystems; it differs from matter in its dissipation, not cycling, characteristics. A new result is the role of storage in diversifying path structure and increasing flows in networks. The basis for this is examined through influence theory of mathematical graphs, with the conclusion that energy storage as biomass is the root cause of ecosystem energy cycling.

As suggested by a simple experiment there can be a time order: first the maximization of empower and then the maximization of exergy. This time sequence is also consistent with a maximization trend in the ratio of exergy to empower. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Energy planning is carried out at a centralized level using computer-based modeling. The centralized energy planning models and approaches have already been reviewed in literature. Decentralized energy planning (DEP) is a concept of recent origin with limited applications. Literature shows that different models are being developed and used worldwide. This paper gives an overview of different decentralized energy models used worldwide, their approaches and their applications along with a few emerging energy models. The central theme of the energy planning at decentralized level would be to prepare an area-based DEP to meet energy needs and development of alternate energy sources at least-cost to the economy and environment. Ecologically sound development of the region is possible when energy needs are integrated with the environmental concerns at the local and global levels. Taking into account these features, this paper explains the need of DEP and shows how different types of energy planning and optimization models, supply demand models, regional models, resource models and neural models have been carried, adopted and applied at decentralized level. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Kestin1980,
abstract = {After a brief historical introduction, this paper proceeds to derive expressions for the available work of a thermodynamic system while the latter interacts with the passive environment. The passive environment is modelled as a union of three idealized reservoirs — energy, volume, and matter. The available work is defined as the optimum amount — largest or smallest — exchanged in circumstances given a prescribed initial and final state of the system. Two types of systems are studied — closed systems and open flow systems — and the interaction is progressively enlarged to include the transfer of heat, the transfer of work, and the transfer of matter. Available work is the difference between the exergy of states 1 and 2; the exergy of a state being defined as the optimum work achieveable against a final state which is one of equilibrium with the surroundings. It is shown that exergy so defined is not a unique quantity for a given system and state, because it also depends on the kind of interaction permitted and therefore on the kind of equilibrium achieved. Exergy, and not energy, is found to represent the preferred measure of a system's “capacity to perform work”. Remarks are made about the contemporary terminology of this field, and regrets are expressed concerning the present day proliferation of terms.},

abstract = {The conceptual design of a biomass integrated gasification fuel cell system for small scale applications (40 kg h−1 woody biomass input with 50{\%} mass fraction water content) is discussed in this work. Two different biomass gasifiers (circulating fluidized bed and downdraft), two different reformers, a solid oxide fuel cell, a gas turbine and a heat recovery steam cycle were investigated. A two-step optimization procedure was used to perform thermo-economic design optimizations of nine system configurations generated by combining different technologies. At the master level an evolutionary algorithm is used to optimize the system intensive parameters following the minimization of the system costs and the maximization of the net power production simultaneously (two-objective). At the inner level, system mass flow rates are optimized by linear programming subject to the thermal balance and to the heat transfer feasibility constraints which were formulated by means of Pinch Analysis techniques. The degree of system internal heat recovery was studied by including the minimum temperature difference between hot and cold streams as a decision variable at the master optimization level. Optimization results are shown by means of an optimal Pareto front for each configuration. The degree of system internal heat recovery of some specific solutions is discussed by means of Pinch Analysis composite curves. The study shows that very high system efficiencies can be obtained but only at the expense of really high system costs mainly because of the high costs of the fuel cell and of the gasifier especially at the small scale level considered here. Minimum specific plant costs of the most cost-effective configuration, based on a hybrid cycle, greater than 7000 {\$} kW−1 (2010 dollars) are found. The indirect circulating fluidized bed gasifier appears the most promising choice both in terms of cost and of system performance since it allows for better thermal integration at high temperatures and greater hydrogen yields. Auto-thermal reforming is a cheaper solution compared to steam reforming but does not benefit of the system internal heat recovery thus leading to comparably lower system efficiency. Steam reforming is particularly convenient when the system is pressurized and extra power can be recovered by gas expansion since a great amount of steam can be injected prior the reformer and vaporized by recovering the heat from exhaust gases.},

abstract = {Transformation of infrastructure systems is understood to be key to developing sustainable, resourceefcient cities (Boyle et al. 2010; Sahely et al. 2005). The framework for urban green growth developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) sees infrastructure, along with innovation and human capital, as being the starting conditions for achieving green jobs, green supply and consumption, and urban attractiveness (Hammer et al. 2011). The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP 2012) identies ve key thematic infrastructure areas for achieving resource efcient citiesbuilding energy efciency, waste management, sustainable urban transport, water/wastewater, and urban ecosystem managementbut stresses that it is integration between sectors and across scales that is most important. Our goal with this special issue on sustainable urban systems is to apply methods of industrial ecology toward the sustainable development of cities, their supporting hinterlands, and the networked infrastructure that connects them. The methods include familiar tools of industrial ecology, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), material ow analysis (MFA), environmental footprinting, and scenario modeling; but there is also an effort to push the interdisciplinary boundaries of in-dustrial ecology even further, linking with other disciplines and recognizing that it is social actors (i.e., people) who shape urban systems. Contributions were encouraged from researchers in a broad range of disciplines, including industrial ecologists, urban ecologists, urban planners, architects, geographers, engineers, economists, environmental scientists, planners, political scientists, and sociologists. The articles address fundamental research, development of cross-cutting conceptual frameworks, applied tools (e.g., lowcarbon development methods), case studies, and interdisciplinary curricula. Several articles in particular address both the biophysical and human dimensions of sustainable urban systems (Castan Broto et al. 2012; Ramaswami et al. 2012b; Hodson et al. 2012). In introducing this special issue, we begin with interdisciplinary overarching articles on urban infrastructure, metabolism, and environmental footprints of cities in the context of social actors, before moving to more specialized articles on energy and carbon, nutrients, water, and waste.},

abstract = {Urban areas are considered net consumers of materials and energy, attracting these from the surrounding hinterland and other parts of the planet. The way these flows are transformed and returned to the environment by the city is important for addressing questions of sustainability and the effect of human behavior on the metabolism of the city. The present work explores these questions with the use of systems analysis, specifically in the form of a Multi-sectoral Systems Analysis (MSA), a tool for research and for supporting decision-making for policy and investment. The application of MSA is illustrated in the context of Greater London, with these three objectives: (a) estimating resource fluxes (nutrients, water and energy) entering, leaving and circulating within the city-watershed system; (b) revealing the synergies and antagonisms resulting from various combinations of water-sector innovations; and (c) estimating the economic benefits associated with implementing these technologies, from the point of view of production of fertilizer and energy, and the reduction of greenhouse gases. Results show that the selection of the best technological innovation depends on which resource is the focus for improvement. Urine separation can potentially recover 47{\%} of the nitrogen in the food consumed in London, with revenue of {\$}33M per annum from fertilizer production. Collecting food waste in sewers together with growing algae in wastewater treatment plants could beneficially increase the amount of carbon release from renewable energy by 66{\%}, with potential annual revenues of {\$}58M from fuel production. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Sciubba2005,
abstract = {The paper discusses the similarities and the incompatibilities between two forms of Energy Analysis (exergy and emergy, 'EXA' and 'EMA' in the following), both of which try to represent the behavior of physical systems by means of cumulative energy input/output methods that result in a double integration over space and time domains. Theoretical background, definitions and balance algebra are discussed first, in a 'statement-counterstatement' format that helps pinpointing differences and similarities. A significant, albeit simplified, benchmark case (ethanol production from corn) is used to compare the results and analytically assess the merits of each approach as well as possible synergic aspects. Corn production, transport and industrial conversion to ethanol are included in the analysis. First, mass balance and energy accounting are performed in each step of the process, then, exergy and emergy evaluations are carried out separately to lead to a set of performance indicators, the meaning of which is discussed with reference to their proper scale of application. The Authors underline that each method has its own preferred field of application and conclude that the two approaches appear to be characterized not much as different (and therefore competing) tools, but as different paradigms, whose meta-levels (their 'philosophies') substantially differ. In particular, EXA is found to provide the most correct and insightful assessment of thermodynamic features of any process and to offer a clear quantitative indication of both the irreversibilities and the degree of matching between the used resources and the end-use material or energy flows. EXA combined with costing considerations results in Thermo-Economics (TE), presently the best engineering method for System optimization. One of EXA recent extensions, Extended Exergy Accounting (EEA) includes all externalities in the exergy resource accounting, thus providing a more complete picture of how a process is interacting with its socio-economical environment and with the Biosphere. EMA further expands the evaluation to the larger scale of the Biosphere and properly accounts for the globality of the energy and resource flows supporting complex living systems. Although some conceptual assumptions and methodological differences appear irreconcilable, important similarities are also found that may lead to further methodological and practical convergences. Note: Although a significant confrontation and debate accompanied the development of this paper, contrasting opinions about important features of the two approaches still exist. Therefore, SU takes full responsibility of statements in Sections 2, 4.1, 6.2, 7.1 while ES takes full responsibility of statements in Sections 3, 4.2, 6.1, 7.2.

The main objective of this review is to provide a state-of-the-art overview of the insight-based techniques developed in the 21st century, particularly those developed for single impurity network of the fixed flow rate problems. Comparisons were also made between these recent techniques and those developed for the fixed load problems in the past century. Various flow rate targeting techniques developed for water reuse/recycle, regeneration, and wastewater treatment are reviewed in detail, along with the network design techniques that achieve the established targets.

abstract = {Cities ("urban superorganisms") exhibit metabolic processes. Disturbance of these processes results from the high throughput of the socioeconomic system as a result of the flow of resources between it and its surroundings. Based on systematic ecology and emergy synthesis, we developed an emergy-based indicator system for evaluating urban metabolic factors (flux, structures, intensity, efficiency, and density), and evaluated the status of Beijing's environment and economic development by diagramming, accounting for, and analyzing the material, energy, and monetary flows within Beijing's metabolic system using biophysically based ecological accounting. We also compared the results with those of four other Chinese cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Ningbo, and Baotou) and China as a whole to assess Beijing's development status. From 1990 to 2004, Beijing's metabolic flux, metabolic intensity, and metabolic density increased significantly. The city's metabolic processes depend excessively on nonrenewable resources, but the pressure on resources from outside of the city decreased continuously. The metabolic efficiency increased by around 12{\%} annually throughout the study period. Beijing had a highest metabolic fluxes and density compared with the four other cities; its metabolic efficiency was lower, and its metabolic intensity was higher. Evaluating these metabolic indicators revealed weaknesses in the urban metabolic system, thereby helping planners to identify measures capable of sustaining these urban metabolic processes.

abstract = {Ecosystem theory has been developed during recent decades, thereby a series of concepts are hypothesized to describe principles inherent to the "natural" function of biological systems at various levels of hierarchy. It seems that a universal trend exists, through evolutionary time and space that allows us to establish indicators that may be used to observe patterns in evolution, even at high levels of hierarchy such as the ecosystem level. The functional principles of ecosystems have evolved over a period of time corresponding to the existence of life on earth say 3-4 billion years. The obvious question immediately arises whether we could learn something from observing these principles. Could we possibly improve our existence by living in accordance with these principles practiced in nature, as exemplified by ecosystems? In this paper, a comparison between natural systems on the one side and industrial-societal systems on the other side is made using 10 target areas as entrance points. It turns out that even though industrial ecologists are aware of and are practicing some points in ecosystem theory, far from all principles, have been exploited. It is suggested that society should increase attention to some of the features where natural systems and societal systems differ greatly. It is hypothesized that industry and society, both in terms of economy and sustainability, would benefit from exploiting these natural principles, even more. This would lead to an intended and deliberate development of the industrial sectors and society in general accordance with the natural ecosystem principles. This led the author to propose the eco-mimetic development of our society. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Energy is a vital input for social and economic development. As a result of the generalization of agricultural, industrial and domestic activities the demand for energy has increased remarkably, especially in emergent countries. This has meant rapid grower in the level of greenhouse gas emissions and the increase in fuel prices, which are the main driving forces behind efforts to utilize renewable energy sources more effectively, i.e. energy which comes from natural resources and is also naturally replenished. Despite the obvious advantages of renewable energy, it presents important drawbacks, such as the discontinuity of generation, as most renewable energy resources depend on the climate, which is why their use requires complex design, planning and control optimization methods. Fortunately, the continuous advances in computer hardware and software are allowing researchers to deal with these optimization problems using computational resources, as can be seen in the large number of optimization methods that have been applied to the renewable and sustainable energy field. This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in computational optimization methods applied to renewable and sustainable energy, offering a clear vision of the latest research advances in this field. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Haberl2002,
abstract = {Part I of this set of articles proposed methods to account for the energetic metabolism of societies. In this second part, the methods explicated in Part I are used to analyze the energy flows of societies with different “modes of subsistence”: hunter-gatherers, a contemporary agricultural society in southeastern Asia, and a contemporary industrial society (Austria). The empirical examples are used to demonstrate differences in the “characteristic metabolism” of different modes of subsistence. The energy system of hunter-gatherers can be described as an “uncontrolled solar energy system,” based mainly upon harvesting biomass without attending to its reproduction. Hunter-gatherers use only about 0.001{\%} to 0.01{\%} of the net primary production (NPP) of the territory they inhabit. Agricultural societies harness NPP to a much higher extent: Although agriculture often reduces NPP, the amount of biomass that agricultural societies use is much higher (about 20{\%} of potential NPP). Because ecological energy flows are the main source of energy for agricultural societies, NPP strictly limits the energetic metabolism of agricultural societies. Industrial society uses area-independent energy sources (fossil and nuclear energy), which, however, result in new sustainability problems, such as greenhouse gas emissions. By providing methods to account for changes in energy flows, the metabolism approach proves itself to be a useful concept for analyzing society-environment interactions. The article demonstrates the difference between the metabolism approach and conventional energy statistics and discusses the significance of the proposed approach for sustainable development.},

In the ITMILP, both two-stage stochastic programming and interval linear programming are introduced into a general mixed integer linear programming framework. Uncertainties expressed as not only probability density functions but also discrete intervals can be reflected. The model can help tackle the dynamic, interactive and uncertain characteristics of the solid waste management system in the City, and can address issues concerning plans for cost-effective waste diversion and landfill prolongation. Three scenarios are considered based on different waste management policies. The results indicate that reasonable solutions have been generated. They are valuable for supporting the adjustment or justification of the existing waste flow allocation patterns, the long-term capacity planning of the City's waste management system, and the formulation of local policies and regulations regarding waste generation and management. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The growing concern for energy, economy and environment calls for an efficient utilization of natural energy resources in developing useful work. An important thermodynamic aspect in gauging the overall energy economy of any physical process is the combined energy and exergy analysis from the identification of process irreversibilities. The present paper makes a comprehensive review pertaining to fundamental studies on thermodynamic irreversibility and exergy analysis in the processes of combustion of gaseous, liquid and solid fuels. The need for such investigations in the context of combustion processes in practice is first stressed upon and then the various approaches of exergy analysis and the results arrived at by different research workers in the field have been discussed. It has been recognized that, in almost all situations, the major source of irreversibilities is the internal thermal energy exchange associated with high-temperature gradients caused by heat release in combustion reactions. The primary way of keeping the exergy destruction in a combustion process within a reasonable limit is to reduce the irreversibility in heat conduction through proper control of physical processes and chemical reactions resulting in a high value of flame temperature but lower values of temperature gradients within the system. The optimum operating condition in this context can be determined from the parametric studies on combustion irreversibilities with operating parameters in different types of flames. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Our study often global cities shows how a balance of geophysical factors (climate, access to resources, and gateway status) and technical factors (power generation, urban design, and waste processing) determine the GHGs attributable to cities. Within the overall trends, however, there are differences between cities with more or less public transit while personal income also impacts heating and industrial fuel use. By including upstream emissions from fuels, GHG emissions attributable to cities exceed those from direct end use by upto 25 Our findings should help foster intercity learning on reducing GHG emissions.},

@article{Cai2009a,
abstract = {In this study, an interval-parameter superiority-inferiority-based two-stage programming model has been developed for supporting community-scale renewable energy management (ISITSP-CREM). This method is based on an integration of the existing interval linear programming (ILP), two-stage programming (TSP) and superiority-inferiority-based fuzzy-stochastic programming (SI-FSP). It allows uncertainties presented as both probability/possibilistic distributions and interval values to be incorporated within a general optimization framework, facilitating the reflection of multiple uncertainties and complexities during the process of renewable energy management systems planning. ISITSP-CREM can also be used for effectively addressing dynamic interrelationships between renewable energy availabilities, economic penalties and electricity-generation deficiencies within a community scale. Thus, complexities in renewable energy management systems can be systematically reflected, highly enhancing applicability of the modeling process. The developed method has then been applied to a case of long-term renewable energy management planning for three communities. Useful solutions for the planning of renewable energy management systems have been generated. Interval solutions associated with different energy availabilities and economic penalties have been obtained. They can be used for generating decision alternatives and thus help decision makers identify desired policies under various economic and system-reliability constraints. The generated solutions can also provide desired energy resource/service allocation plans with a minimized system cost (or economic penalties), a maximized system reliability level and a maximized energy security. Tradeoffs between system costs and energy security can also be tackled. Higher costs will increase potential energy generation amount, while a desire for lower system costs will run into a risk of energy deficiency. They are helpful for supporting: (a) adjustment or justification of allocation patterns of renewable energy resources and services, (b) formulation of local policies regarding energy utilization, economic development and energy structure under various energy availabilities and policy interventions, and (c) analysis of interactions among economic cost, system reliability and energy-supply shortage. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A complex functional product usually consists of many parts made of different materials and its LCA-oriented life cycle modeling involves many complex semantic relationships. In this paper, a new LCA-oriented and ontology-based semantic representation model and methodology for the product life cycle are proposed. First, the concepts of processes and flows, and the semantic relationships among processes, and between processes and flows are analyzed in detail. The ontology classes of processes and flows are defined using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Then, an LCA-oriented semantic concept model for the product life cycle is presented. Based on the proposed semantic representation model, all processes, flows, and the relationships among them can be represented as a Resource Description Framework (RDF) graph in which each node is an instance tagged by an ontology class. A formalization of lifecycle processes on flows is provided, which can be encoded with Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) and formed into a knowledge rule base. In addition, a semantic query method for the life cycle inventory of a product is proposed. Finally, an implementation framework and an example of the semantic representation for a ball bearing's life cycle are provided.},

abstract = {The deployment of plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) and micro-combined heat and power (micro-CHP) technologies create the opportunity to enhance energy service networks by coordinating these small-scale devices under various dispatch schemes. Furthermore, if vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and thermal storage features are considered, these embedded technologies could have even a greater impact on network performance. Therefore, this work presents a holistic modelling framework which serves as a tool to optimise in a coordinated manner the operation of natural gas and electrical infrastructures under the presence of distributed energy resources (DERs). The modelling tool developed, under the name TCOPF, is a decision maker entity that aggregates and coordinates the available DERs according to utility conditions. As a consequence, the tool functions by employing an integrated time coordinated electric and natural gas optimal power ow. Hence, once the results are analysed, the output allows stakeholders to identify techno-economical tradeo s that might be encountered by applying particular operating strategies and load control approaches. To illustrate the value of the modelling tool, a case study is assessed by evaluating di erent objective functions which simulate diverse operating strategies of utilities. The examples prove the TCOPF acts as an ecient intermediary entity that manages cost-e ective interactions between the connected technologies and the distribution network operators (DNOs). Results show considerable bene ts in operating electrical networks while simultaneously having mild e ects in natural gas networks. Furthermore, the modelling tool describes the optimal dispatch patterns distributed energy resources should follow in order to improve the performance of urban energy service networks. Thus, the TCOPF program o ers a fresh perspective for stakeholders wishing to successfully integrate and coordinate in a seamlessly fashion the operation of distributed energy resources with the operating strategies of energy utilities.},

abstract = {Waste is the symbol of inefficiency of any modern society and a representation of misallocated resources. Significant progress has been achieved in reducing waste but it varies from city to city. Currently, cities use their waste diversion rate as a tool to measure the performance of their waste management systems. However, diversion of waste from landfill does not give a holistic picture of zero waste performance. This paper conceptualises the concept of the 'zero waste city' and proposes a new tool to measure the performance of waste management systems called the 'zero waste index'. The zero waste index forecasts the amount of virgin materials, energy, water and greenhouse gas emissions substituted by the resources that are recovered from waste streams. Three high consuming cities (Adelaide, San Francisco and Stockholm) were analysed using the zero waste index. The zero waste indexes in Adelaide, San Francisco and Stockholm were found to be 0.23, 0.51 and 0.17 respectively (i.e. around 23{\%}, 51{\%} and 17{\%} of resources were recovered and potentially substituted for virgin materials). In addition, the zero waste index estimated the potential energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) and water savings due to resource recovery from municipal solid waste in each of the three cities. It is evident that the zero waste index is an innovative tool to assess waste management performance and materials substitution by waste management systems in different cities. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Analyzing the structure and functioning of the urban system revealed ways to optimize its structure by adjusting the relationships among compartments, thereby demonstrating how ecological network analysis can be used in urban system research. Based on the account of the extended exergy utilization in the sector of urban socio-economic system, which is considered as the composition of extraction (Ex), conversion (Co), agriculture (Ag), industry (In), transportation (Tr), tertiary (Te) and households (Do) sectors, an urban ecological network model is constructed to gain insights into the economic processes oriented to sustainable urban development. Taking Beijing city as the case, the network accounting and related ecological evaluation of a practical urban economy are carried out in this study in the light of flux, efficiency, utility and structure analysis. The results showed that a large quantity of energy and resources have to be consumed to maintain the structure and function of a city. The thermodynamic efficiencies of individual sector in Beijing remain at a low level. The social system in Beijing is a highly competitive network, and there are 8 competitive relations and only two mutualistic ones. The Domestic and Agricultural sector are the major controlling factors of the system. Moreover, the assessment results of Beijing are compared with the other three socio-economic systems, Norway, UK and Italy, and the ecological network function and structure comparisons are correspondingly illuminated and discussed. The conclusions indicate that the exergy-based network analysis can be refined to become an integrative tool for evaluation, policy-making and regulation for urban socio-economic system management concerning structure and efficiency at urban levels. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We introduce a new 'multi-layered' indicator set for urban metabolism (UM) studies in megacities. The indicator set is designed for gathering information on the definition (spatial boundaries, constituent cities, population, economy), biophysical characteristics (climate, population density, building floor area), and metabolic flows (water, waste, materials, and all types of energy) of megacities. In addition, it addresses the role of utilities in the provision of services and regulatory actions that, along with public governance, may influence (and/or control) the urban metabolism. In the article, we give background context to the growth and development of megacities, their overarching socio-economic issues, and the definition of their boundaries. Two methodologies to define megacity boundaries are compared, showing that the definition of 'megacity' is not trivial and that further investigation is needed to establish a baseline for comparison of urban metabolism data. Use of the standardized indicator set will ease inter-city comparisons of urban metabolism, whilst enhancing knowledge of megacities and their transformation into sustainable systems.},

abstract = {National Infrastructure (NI) provides the foundation for economic productivity and human wellbeing, and is the cornerstone of modern industrialised society. It shapes many of the interactions between human civilisation and the natural environment. However, in the UK and other advanced economies, NI faces serious challenges of: • Growing demand for infrastructure services from a modern economy and growing and ageing population; • Significant investment requirements so that an ageing infrastructure system can meet this demand and provide reliable, cost-effective and high quality services; • Increasing complexity and interdependence of infrastructure networks. A growing stock of infrastructure helps to promote economic growth by increasing productivity, participation in the economy and aggregate demand. Infrastructure investment is also necessary to reduce the likelihood and consequences of system failure and to ensure a healthy environment and a stable climate. The lead-time and long lifetime of major infrastructure means that a long term view is essential. Yet a long term strategic approach is challenged by the associated uncertainties, be they technical, environmental, political or financial. Interdependence between infrastructure sectors add to the complexity and uncertainty in the strategic planning of NI.},

abstract = {Carbon fluxes scenario within urban areas plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, which is critical for the adjustment of urban development activities influencing our living environment. Adapting network environ theory, a generic metabolic model is developed in this study for carbon metabolism in urban areas, in which compartmental utility analysis and system performance assessment are featured. Taking carbon dynamic of Hong Kong as a case study, the metabolic flows within urban carbon balance are illustrated though two analogous input/output networks. Based on this, the compartmental mutual relationships between different urban sectors are addressed and the overall properties of the city's carbon metabolism are aggregately evaluated. Our findings showed that each metabolic component has its specific mutual relations with other components connected, playing a unique role within the ecological system. As to Hong Kong's case, specifically, the metabolic system is considered self-mutual and stable when incorporating its interactions with its supporting environment. In light of these insights, potential extensions and applications of the network-based metabolic model in future are discussed. The recommendation is that the tracking of interactive relationships and pathways from network environ perspective be incorporated into present urban metabolism study for a more comprehensive sustainable urban design.},

A thorough understanding of exergy and the insights it can provide into the efficiency, environmental impact and sustainability of energy systems, are required for the engineer or scientist working in the area of energy systems and the environment. Further, as energy policies play an increasingly important role in addressing sustainability issues and a broad range of local, regional and global environmental concerns, policy makers also need to appreciate the exergy concept and its ties to these concerns. During the past decade, the need to understand the connections between exergy and energy, sustainable development and environmental impact has become increasingly significant. In this paper, a study of these connections is presented in order to provide to those involved in energy and environment studies, useful insights and direction for analyzing and solving environmental problems of varying complexity using the exergy concept. The results suggest that exergy provides the basis for an effective measure of the potential of a substance or energy form to impact the environment and appears to be a critical consideration in achieving sustainable development.},

abstract = {In the last decade, technological innovations and a changing economic and regulatory environment have resulted in a renewed interest for distributed energy resources (DER). However, because of the lack of a suitable design tool, the expected potential of DER penetration is not always exerted sufficiently. In this paper, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model has been developed for the integrated plan and evaluation of DER systems. Given the site's energy loads, local climate data, utility tariff structure, and information (both technical and financial) on candidate DER technologies, the model minimizes overall energy cost for a test year by selecting the units to install and determining their operating schedules. Furthermore, the economic, energetic and environmental effects of the DER system can be evaluated. As an illustrative example, an investigation has been conducted of economically optimal DER system for an eco-campus in Kitakyushu, Japan. The result illustrates that gas engine is currently the most popular DER technology from the economic point of view. Although holding reasonable economic merits, unless combined with heat recovery units, the introduction of DER technologies may result in marginal or even adverse environmental effects. Furthermore, according to the results of sensitivity analysis, the optimal system combination and corresponding economic and environmental performances are more or less sensitive to the scale of energy demand, energy prices (both electricity and city gas), as well as carbon tax rate. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is found that for the city of Athens, where the mean heat island intensity exceeds 10??C, the cooling load of urban buildings may be doubled, the peak electricity load for cooling purposes may be tripled especially for higher set point temperatures, while the minimum COP value of air conditioners may be decreased up to 25{\%} because of the higher ambient temperatures. During the winter period, the heating load of centrally located urban buildings is found to be reduced up to 30{\%}. Regarding the potential of natural ventilation techniques when applied to buildings located in urban canyons, it is found that, mainly during the day, this is seriously reduced because of the important decrease of the wind speed inside the canyon. Air flow reduction may be up to 10 times the flow that corresponds to undisturbed ambient wind conditions. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The life cycle energy use of palm oil methyl ester was calculated and reported using these five different indicators for energy use, giving considerably different output results. This is in itself not unexpected, but indicates the importance of clearly identifying, describing and motivating the choice of energy use indicator.

Based on ecological thermodynamics, an indicator system is established in this paper to evaluate the fluxes, stocks, and effiency of the urban material metabolism using emergy analysis. Also, a new model for the urban material metabolism is proposed to define the production possibility curve using a wealth index (WI) and an ecological effiency index (EEI). Then, six large Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen are selected as typical cases to validate the proposed model. The results show that Shenzhen has the highest metabolic capacity, followed by Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Chongqing. It is also reflected that different urban material metabolisms of the six cities are resulted from the varied regional metabolic capacities, thus providing insights into how cities improve their metabolic capacities. Meanwhile, Shenzhen has the highest WI and EEI, Chongqing has the lowest WI and EEI, and Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou has low WI and high EEI.

abstract = {Methods and indicators are needed to assess the urban ecosystem health status, amongst which energy and material metabolism should be integrated to enhance understanding of ecological patterns and processes of urban ecosystems. Therefore, emergy synthesis combining energetics with systems ecology is applied to assess systematically the health status of urban ecosystems. Combining ecosystem health levels with spatial geographical information of different land use subsystems, the spatial distribution of urban ecosystem health is obtained, which is helpful for urban ecological regulation and spatial optimization. Taking the situation of Guangzhou, China in 2005 as a case study, the relative health states based on emergy indicators and set pair analysis is evaluated. Results show that the health levels of the cultivated land, as well as areas with middle and low density buildings are relatively positive, while that of high density building and traffic areas are relatively weak. Through analysis of different land use subsystems, required factors of a healthy ecosystem are summarized, including moderate economic productivity but without much exploitation and disturbance, reasonable structure of energy and resources usage, medium resilience under pressure, moderate ecosystem service provisioning, and small environmental impact on surroundings. The spatial distribution of urban ecosystem health states is also obtained, such that the northern part of Guangzhou is defined as the conservation area, the middle and southern parts are defined as the maintenance area, while the south central and south western parts are defined as the key regulation area where a suitable scheme should be implemented to control the population density and resolve the concomitant problems. Moreover, the impact power of different indicators on the final health status is classified into five levels when combining the indicator weights with the main assessment factors of urban ecosystem health, which is useful for defining the regulation priority amongst a few indicators. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study presents an overview of footprints as defined indicators that can be used to measure sustainability. An overview of the definitions and units of measurement associated with environmental, social, and economic footprints is important because the definitions of footprints vary and are often expressed unclearly. Composite footprints combining two or more individual footprints are also assessed. These combinations produce multi-objective optimisation problems. Several tools for footprint(s)' evaluation are presented, including some of the numerous carbon footprint calculators, available calculators for other footprints, some ecological footprints-based, graph-based, and mathematical programming tools. A comprehensive overview is offered of footprint-based sustainability assessment. Copyright ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An integrated ecological evaluation of the Beijing economy was presented in the paper based on the emergy accounting with the data in 2004. Through calculating environmental and economic inputs within and outside the Beijing economy, this paper discusses the Beijing's resource structure, economic situation and trade status based on a series of emergy indicators. Through the comparison of the systematic indicators of Beijing with those of the selected Chinese cities, the general status of the Beijing economy in China is identified. The results also show that most indicators of Beijing are located at middle levels among the selected Chinese cities. Particularly, the environmental impacts, expressed by the ratio of waste to the renewable emergy, and the ratio of waste to the total emergy use, are 84.2 and 0.26, respectively in Beijing in 2004, which indicate that the Beijing economy is greatly reliant on the imported intensive fuels, goods and services with high empower density and environmental loading. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The present work makes a comparison between the two most used environmental sustainability indices of nations: "ecological footprint" and "environmental sustainability index", with two emergy ratios (renewability and emergy sustainability index). All of them are gaining space within the scientific community and government officials. Despite the efforts for obtaining an index that adequately represents the sustainability of a region, according to the result of this research, nowadays there is not yet a completely satisfactory index. We consider that all of them need to be improved, but the results point out the possibility of obtaining one better index of sustainability through the junction of ecological footprint with renewability emergy index. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Urban environmental sustainability assessment is increasingly a part of urban planning, from the perspective of mitigating local and global impacts and for adapting to regional and global resource constraints and anticipated climate events. We examine general techniques under three categories: consumption-based, metabolism-based and complex systems approaches. We sample recent and salient applications at spatial scales ranging from neighbourhoods to metropolitan regions. The scope and strengths of applications in these categories are complementary especially with regards to the attribution of impact. The first approach assesses environmental sustainability as a function of urban consumption, the second uses a more limited concept of consumption but better represents local and trans-boundary production activity and the third attributes cause and effect through quantifying relationships and feedbacks throughout the urban system. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {The use of exergy is described as a measure for identifying and explaining the benefits of sustainable energy and technologies, so the benefits can be clearly understood and appreciated by experts and non-experts alike, and the utilization of sustainable energy and technologies can be increased. Exergy can be used to assess and improve energy systems, and can help better understand the benefits of utilizing green energy by providing more useful and meaningful information than energy provides. Exergy clearly identifies efficiency improvements and reductions in thermodynamic losses attributable to more sustainable technologies. A new sustainability index is developed as a measure of how exergy efficiency affects sustainable development. Exergy can also identify better than energy the environmental benefits and economics of energy technologies. The results suggest that exergy should be utilized by engineers and scientists, as well as decision and policy makers, involved in green energy and technologies in tandem with other objectives and constraints. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
