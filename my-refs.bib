abstract = {A new systematic methodology for designing wastewater and heat exchange networks for process industries involving effluent streams containing multiple contaminants is proposed. A simultaneous optimization approach mathematically combines the problems of wastewater and heat exchanger network optimization into a single step. This process includes two global iterations of a similar two-stage approach and optimizes networks for water and heat exchange simultaneously based on cost estimation. The objective function is to minimize the total annual cost of the wastewater and heat exchange network design which is subject to the mass and energy balance constraints on all the pertinent flows and to constraints related to the concentrations of contaminants. The proposed method employs a strategy to address a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) formulation. Cost estimates for optimized wastewater and heat exchange networks for an oil refinery process are generated, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The process models are utilized to relate the variables (i.e., flow rate and concentration) of process output (typically defined as internal water source) with those of process input (i.e., water sink).Ageneralized water network superstructure is developed to embed all possible process units and all the connections among resources, interceptors, process units, and wastes. The problem is formulated as four optimization problems (minimum freshwater flow rate, intercepted flow rate, intercepted mass load, and number of connections), and the four models are solved in sequence to locate the targets. A literature case is used to validate the proposed approach. Moreover, a sour water network of a practical refinery plant is presented to illustrate the appli- cability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The process yield increases in average 2.4{\%} for modified process due to recycling operation. In modified process is obtained 28{\%} more product mass, specific energy consumption decreases up to 4.8{\%} and losses of Li/kg of product decreased by 83{\%} compared to conventional process. The water consumption per kg of product in modified process is 1{\%}-6.3{\%}, being lower than in conventional process.

abstract = {In many regions, conventional water supplies are unable to meet projected consumer demand. Consequently, interest has arisen in integrated urban water systems, which involve the reclamation or harvesting of alternative, localized water sources. However, this makes the planning and design of water infrastructure more difficult, as multiple objectives need to be considered, water sources need to be selected from a number of alternatives, and end uses of these sources need to be specified. In addition, the scale at which each treatment, collection, and distribution network should operate needs to be investigated. In order to deal with this complexity, a framework for planning and designing water infrastructure taking into account integrated urban water management principles is presented in this paper and applied to a rural greenfield development. Various options for water supply, and the scale at which they operate were investigated in order to determine the life-cycle trade-offs between water savings, cost, and GHG emissions as calculated from models calibrated using Australian data. The decision space includes the choice of water sources, storage tanks, treatment facilities, and pipes for water conveyance. For each water system analyzed, infrastructure components were sized using multiobjective genetic algorithms. The results indicate that local water sources are competitive in terms of cost and GHG emissions, and can reduce demand on the potable system by as much as 54{\%}. Economies of scale in treatment dominated the diseconomies of scale in collection and distribution of water. Therefore, water systems that connect large clusters of households tend to be more cost efficient and have lower GHG emissions. In addition, water systems that recycle wastewater tended to perform better than systems that captured roof-runoff. Through these results, the framework was shown to be effective at identifying near optimal trade-offs between competing objectives, thereby enabling informed decisions to be made when planning water systems for greenfield developments.},

To find an optimal WTE network in the Ulsan EIP, a fuzzy mixed integer linear programming mathematical model was developed to meet energy supply and demand (in terms of both quantity and grade) while considering the satisfaction level of potential stakeholders (e.g., the EIP initiator and tenants). The developed model was applied to two different scenarios that considered the requirements of EIP tenants for waste treatment and energy recovery. Based on the satisfaction level of the stakeholders, the WTE networks were analyzed to establish an optimal WTE network with maximum energy production and a minimal payback period. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Japan.},

In this paper, we expand the previous optimization framework by considering the processing of microalgae residue previously treated as wastes. We develop an expanded biorefinery superstructure model, based on which a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is proposed to determine the optimal/promising biorefinery configurations with different choices of objective functions. The MINLP model is solved in GAMS using a database built in Excel. Economic sensitivity analysis is performed to elaborate the potential improvements in the overall economics, and set the targets that must be achieved in the future in order for microalgal biofuels to become economically viable.},

abstract = {Biomass-fired cogeneration not only is an environmentally friendly energy production, but also possesses high energy conversion efficiency. Generally, the wood product industry requires both heat and electricity. Combined heat and power generation (cogeneration) using wood residue has a three-fold benefit: waste minimization, reduction of an energy-related production cost and additional income from selling the excess electricity to the utility. In reality, the process heat demand fluctuates according to the production activities in the factory. The fluctuation of process heat demand affects the cogeneration efficiency and the electricity output and, consequently, the financial return, since the prices of heat and electricity are different. A study by computer simulation to establish a guideline for optimum operation of a process heat fluctuating cogeneration power plant is presented. The power plant was designed for a sawmill and an adjacent plywood factory using wood wastes from these two processes. The maximum boiler thermal load is 81.9 MW while the electricity output is in the range 19-24 MW and the process heat 10-30 MW. Two modes of operation were studied, namely the full (boiler) load and the partial (boiler) load. In the full load operation, the power plant is operated at a maximum boiler thermal load, while the extracted steam is varied to meet the steam demand of the wood-drying kilns and the plywood production. The partial load operation was designed for the partially fuelled boiler to provide sufficient steam for the process and to generate electricity at a desired capacity ranging from the firmed contract of 19 MW to the turbine maximum capacity of 24 MW. It was found that the steam for process heat has an allowable extracting range, which is limited by the low pressure feed water heater. The optimum operation for both full and partial load occurs at the lower limit of the extracting steam. A guideline for optimum operation at various combinations of electricity output and steam demand is presented. The maximum achievable overall efficiency is 64.6 per cent when the power plant is operated at partial (boiler) load condition for 19 MW electricity and 30 MW process heat. The full load operation, although having lower overall efficiency, is preferable financially because of the higher unit price of electricity in comparison with heat.},

The cost drivers from an internal combustion engine's characteristics to facilitate a cost estimate for high-volume production are also presented. A process to enable a costing expert to either build an estimate for the new technology under analysis or use a comparator and then develop a variant for the new system is also discussed.

abstract = {The conceptual design of a biomass integrated gasification fuel cell system for small scale applications (40 kg h−1 woody biomass input with 50{\%} mass fraction water content) is discussed in this work. Two different biomass gasifiers (circulating fluidized bed and downdraft), two different reformers, a solid oxide fuel cell, a gas turbine and a heat recovery steam cycle were investigated. A two-step optimization procedure was used to perform thermo-economic design optimizations of nine system configurations generated by combining different technologies. At the master level an evolutionary algorithm is used to optimize the system intensive parameters following the minimization of the system costs and the maximization of the net power production simultaneously (two-objective). At the inner level, system mass flow rates are optimized by linear programming subject to the thermal balance and to the heat transfer feasibility constraints which were formulated by means of Pinch Analysis techniques. The degree of system internal heat recovery was studied by including the minimum temperature difference between hot and cold streams as a decision variable at the master optimization level. Optimization results are shown by means of an optimal Pareto front for each configuration. The degree of system internal heat recovery of some specific solutions is discussed by means of Pinch Analysis composite curves. The study shows that very high system efficiencies can be obtained but only at the expense of really high system costs mainly because of the high costs of the fuel cell and of the gasifier especially at the small scale level considered here. Minimum specific plant costs of the most cost-effective configuration, based on a hybrid cycle, greater than 7000 {\$} kW−1 (2010 dollars) are found. The indirect circulating fluidized bed gasifier appears the most promising choice both in terms of cost and of system performance since it allows for better thermal integration at high temperatures and greater hydrogen yields. Auto-thermal reforming is a cheaper solution compared to steam reforming but does not benefit of the system internal heat recovery thus leading to comparably lower system efficiency. Steam reforming is particularly convenient when the system is pressurized and extra power can be recovered by gas expansion since a great amount of steam can be injected prior the reformer and vaporized by recovering the heat from exhaust gases.},

The Urban Harvest concept includes urban metabolism and closing urban cycles by harvesting urban resources. The purpose of this study was to quantify the potentials to harvest water and energy at different scales. We investigated potentials for the Netherlands. Results show that at national scale, potentials can cover up to 100{\%} of electricity demand, 55{\%} of heat demand and 52{\%} of tap water demand. At neighborhood level, similar percentages were found for energy. Only 43{\%} of water demand was achieved, due to fact that treatment measures were not considered. These results indicate the large potential of cities as providers of their own resources. Therefore urban resources management is a key element of future city design towards more resilient cities.},

Evidence also indicates that cities have historically played an important role in facilitating the creation of recycling linkages between different industries. If Kalundborg and other newly documented cases of localized interfirm recycling linkages are but contemporary manifestations of much older processes, then what are the policy implications for current attempts to plan eco-industrial parks? $\backslash$nThis article explores this issue by looking at the economic incentives that have always led to the formation of cities and interfirm recycling linkages at both the local and interregional levels. A critique of current interpretations and policy prescriptions based on the Kalundborg case is then offered. I argue that current attempts to foster the development of eco-industrial parks and eco-industrial networks are too narrow in their geographical scope, that public planning is unlikely to prove more efficient than private initiatives, and that perhaps the most important lesson to be learned from Kalundborg is thevalue of a flexible regulatory framework.},

abstract = {This lecture treats some enduring misconceptions about modeling. One of these is that the goal is always prediction. The lecture distinguishes between explanation and prediction as modeling goals, and offers sixteen reasons other than prediction to build a model. It also challenges the common assumption that scientific theories arise from and 'summarize' data, when often, theories precede and guide data collection; without theory, in other words, it is not clear what data to collect. Among other things, it also argues that the modeling enterprise enforces habits of mind essential to freedom.  It is based on the author's 2008 Bastille Day keynote address to the Second World Congress on Social Simulation, George Mason University, and earlier addresses at the Institute of Medicine, the University of Michigan, and the Santa Fe Institute.},

SUMMARY This paper describes the situation of livestock development, its constraints and farmer's strategies to manage their livestock in the composite swidden agroecosystem in Tat hamlet, Northern Uplands, Vietnam. The results revealed that livestock production has considerably increased in terms of quality and quantity in the upland hamlet as livestock has contributed very important roles for household economies. A number of factors exert positive influences on livestock development such as government policies to promote livestock development, increased wealth of many households which allows them to invest more money in livestock, and a high demand for livestock from the lowland market. However, livestock development in Tat hamlet also faces a number of serious constraints, including: (i) the limited local demand for livestock products and the consequent reliance on selling livestock to outsiders; (ii) low productivity of native breeds and risks surrounding the introduction of new hybrid breeds; (iii) conflicts between large livestock and swidden farming; (iv) shortages of pasture for buffalo and cattle; and (v) lack of institutional support for livestock production. Nevertheless, local farmers have developed their strategies to overcome their constraints such as diversification of livestock and farming activities, raising livestock in the remove farms.},

abstract = {AbstractVarious multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been applied to solve the optimal design problems of a water distribution system (WDS). Such methods are able to find the near-optimal trade-off between cost and performance benefit in a single run. Previously published work used a number of small benchmark networks and/or a few large, real-world networks to test MOEAs on design problems of WDS. A few studies also focused on the comparison of different MOEAs given a limited computational budget. However, no consistent attempt has been made before to investigate and report the best-known approximation of the true Pareto front (PF) for a set of benchmark problems, and thus there is not a single point of reference. This paper applied 5 state-of-the-art MOEAs, with minimum time invested in parameterization (i.e., using the recommended settings), to 12 design problems collected from the literature. Three different population sizes were implemented for each MOEA with respect to the scale of eac...},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Dynamic modelling is one of the cornerstones of systems biology. Many research efforts are currently being invested in the development and exploitation of large-scale kinetic models. The associated problems of parameter estimation (model calibration) and optimal experimental design are particularly challenging. The community has already developed many methods and software packages which aim to facilitate these tasks. However, there is a lack of suitable benchmark problems which allow a fair and systematic evaluation and comparison of these contributions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:Here we present BioPreDyn-bench, a set of challenging parameter estimation problems which aspire to serve as reference test cases in this area. This set comprises six problems including medium and large-scale kinetic models of the bacterium E. coli, baker's yeast S. cerevisiae, the vinegar fly D. melanogaster, Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, and a generic signal transduction network. The level of description includes metabolism, transcription, signal transduction, and development. For each problem we provide (i) a basic description and formulation, (ii) implementations ready-to-run in several formats, (iii) computational results obtained with specific solvers, (iv) a basic analysis and interpretation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS:This suite of benchmark problems can be readily used to evaluate and compare parameter estimation methods. Further, it can also be used to build test problems for sensitivity and identifiability analysis, model reduction and optimal experimental design methods.

abstract = {Water distribution networks (WDNs) play a crucial role in the well-being of human populations and economic prosperity. It is essential that they cope with abnormal operating conditions and recover functionality quickly. Traditionally, WDNs are designed using cost and reliability objectives, but there is a lack of consensus on the definition and quantification of reliability which typically is a computationally intense process. Subsequently, various reliability-like metrics, called resilience indices, have been developed and demonstrated in the design of WDNs. Few studies exist that thoroughly evaluate the performance of the previously developed resilience metrics. This paper investigates three resilience metrics by evaluating their performance on three benchmark WDNs for several simulated mechanical failure states. The metrics studied are: (a) resilience index, (b) network resilience index (NRI), and (c) modified resilience index (MRI). The metric MRI performed better overall but NRI produced cheaper designs that performed better in the case of WDN-I. It is recommended that a better metric that incorporates different dimensions of resilience, such as robustness and redundancy, should be developed in the future.},

We replace the more typical gradient descent optimizer used in deformable models with GA, and the convex, implicit, global shape statistics with nonconvex, explicit, localized ones. Specifically, we propose GA to reduce typical deformable model weaknesses pertaining to model initialization, pose estimation and local minima, through the simultaneous evolution of a large number of models. Furthermore, we constrain the evolution, and thus reduce the size of the search-space, by using statistically-based deformable models whose deformations are intuitive (stretch, bulge, bend) and are driven in terms of localized principal modes of variation, instead of modes of variation across the entire shape that often fail to capture localized shape changes. Although GA are not guaranteed to achieve the global optima, our method compares favorably to the prevalent optimization techniques, convex/nonconvex gradient-based optimizers and to globally optimal graph-theoretic combinatorial optimization techniques, when applied to the task of corpus callosum segmentation in 50 mid-sagittal brain magnetic resonance images.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present and analyze a new aggregate model of urban traffic. The main challenge in the formulation of an aggregate model is to analytically grasp the correlation between the different components of the network while maintaining a tractable model. This correlation explains congestion effects and quantifies their overall network impact. Our an-alytic queueing network model captures this correlation and can therefore explicitly model complex phenomena such as spillbacks. This is useful to identify the sources of congestion (e.g. bottlenecks) and quantify their effects (Osorio and Bierlaire, forthcoming). This analytic model fits well within an optimization framework. We illustrate this in the context of the optimization of traffic signal timing in the network of the city of Lausanne. The aggregate model is calibrated using the outputs of a disaggregate model, that is a mi-croscopic traffic simulation model. The analytic formulation of this optimization problem is presented. The optimal solution is then evaluated with the microscopic traffic simulation model. Its performance is compared with that of several other methods.

The current study aimed at assessing environmental and human health risks related to urban waste management in Yamoussoukro, the political capital of C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire. We undertook trans-disciplinary research within an Ecohealth approach, comprised of a participatory workshop with stakeholders and mapping of exposure patterns. A total of 492 randomly selected households participated in a cross-sectional survey. Waste deposit sites were characterised and 108 wastewater samples were subjected to laboratory examinations. The physico-chemical parameters of the surface water (temperature, pH, conductivity, potential oxidise reduction, BOD(5), COD, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, ammonia and total Kendal nitrogen) did not comply with World Health Organization standards of surface water quality. Questionnaire results showed that malaria was the most commonly reported disease. Diarrhoea and malaria were associated with poor sanitation. Households having dry latrines had a higher risk of diarrhoea (odds ratio (OR) = 1.8, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.2–2.7) compared to latrines with septic tanks and also a higher risk for malaria (OR = 1.9, 95{\%} (CI) 1.1–3.3). Our research showed that combining health and environmental assessments enables a deeper understanding of environmental threats and disease burdens linked to poor waste management. Further study should investigate the sanitation strategy aspects that could reduce the environmental and health risks in the study area.},

abstract = {Solid waste management is a large and growing problem for countries in the developing world and is often a neglected aspect of urban management. However, poor waste management can contribute to the impact of urban flooding by blocking drainage, increasing debris and harbouring disease vectors. A review of the literature and analysis of case studies (both from the literature and from examples collected in the preparation of a global urban flood handbook) confirm that solid waste management is an emerging issue in flood risk management practice. Approaches to improve waste management included large municipal programmes and locally based community schemes. It was seen to be important that the management of waste is adopted as part of a wide integrated flood management programme. The research demonstrates that waste management can be an effective response to flood risk but, in order to remain successful, it requires that sufficient commitment and engagement can be mobilised in the long term. {\textcopyright} 2012 WIT Press.},

abstract = {The focus of this article is the scale of freight transport, in relation to the overall material turnover of society and the size of metabolically interdependent population and territory, across various ideal-type historical modes of subsistence. By a newly-developed formal model (calibrated on empirical relations from early nineteenth-century central Europe), we are able to calculate transport volumes, under certain model assumptions, for hunter and gatherer societies and for agrarian societies. For the latter, we can demonstrate that the volume of transport necessarily rises faster than both the size of the society (in terms of population of urban centers and their hinterland) and its material wealth, and this not only constrains but limits the possible size of urban populations. The core mechanism behind these limits is the agrarian energy metabolism. In order to overcome distances, agrarian societies need more land to feed the human and animal labor power required for transportation. So they have to enlarge their territory, thereby again increasing distances to be overcome. Fossil fuels provide a double benefit: they allow people to span larger distances, and to manage reproduction within a smaller area. So under industrial conditions, size-constraints for urban centers and for freight transport disappear and transport volumes "explode."},

abstract = {Improvement in nutrient recycling in agriculture is essential to maintain food production while minimising nutrient pollution of the environment. For this purpose, understanding and modelling nutrient cycles in food and related agro-industrial systems is a crucial task. Although nutrient management has been addressed at the plot and farm scales for many years now in the agricultural sciences, there is a need to upscale these approaches to capture the additional drivers of nutrient cycles that may occur at the local, i.e. district, scale. Industrial ecology principles provide sound bases to analyse nutrient cycling in complex systems. However, since agro-food social-ecological systems have specific ecological and social dimensions, we argue that a new field, referred to as "Agro-Industrial Ecology", is needed to study these systems. In this paper, we review the literature on nutrient cycling in complex social-ecological systems that can provide a basis for Agro-Industrial Ecology. We identify and describe three major approaches: Environmental Assessment tools, Stock and Flow Analysis methods and Agent-based models. We then discuss their advantages and drawbacks for assessing and modelling nutrient cycles in agro-food systems in terms of their purpose and scope, object representation and time-spatial dynamics. We finally argue that combining stock-flow methods with both agent-based models and environmental impact assessment tools is a promising way to analyse the role of economic agents on nutrient flows and losses and to explore scenarios that better close the nutrient cycles at the local scale.},

abstract = {Military bases resemble small cities and face similar sustainability challenges. As pilot studies in the U.S. Army Net Zero program, 17 locations are moving to 100{\%} renewable energy, zero depletion of water resources, and/or zero waste to landfill by 2020. Some bases target net zero in a single area, such as water, whereas two bases, including Fort Carson, Colorado, target net zero in all three areas. We investigated sustainability strategies that appear when multiple areas (energy, water, and waste) are integrated. A system dynamics model is used to simulate urban metabolism through Fort Carson's energy, water, and waste systems. Integrated scenarios reduce environmental impact up to 46{\%} from the 2010 baseline, whereas single-dimension scenarios (energy-only, water-only, and waste-only) reduce impact, at most, 20{\%}. Energy conserving technologies offer mutual gains, reducing annual energy use 18{\%} and water use 15{\%}. Renewable energy sources present trade-offs: Concentrating solar power could supply 11{\%} of energy demand, but increase water demand 2{\%}. Waste to energy could supply 40{\%} of energy demand and reduce waste to landfill {\textgreater}80{\%}, but increase water demand between 1{\%} and 22{\%} depending on cooling system and waste tonnage. Outcomes depend on how the Fort Carson system is defined, because some components represent multiple net zero areas (food represents waste and energy), and some actions require embodied resources (energy generation potentially requires water and off-base feedstock). We suggest that integrating multiple net zero goals can lead to lower environmental impact for military bases.},

abstract = {There are various definitions of 'zero energy' and 'net-zero' energy building. In most cases, the definitions refer only to the energy that is used in the operation of the building, ignoring the aspects of energy use related to the construction and delivery of the building and its components. On the other hand the concept of 'net energy' as used in the field of ecological economics, which does take into account the energy used during the production process of a commodity, is widely applied in fields such as renewable energy assessment. In this paper the concept of 'net energy' is introduced and applied within the built environment, based on a methodology accounting for the embodied energy of building components together with energy use in operation. A definition of life cycle zero energy buildings (LC-ZEB) is proposed, as well as the use of the net energy ratio (NER) as a factor to aid in building design with a life cycle perspective. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The vision of Cities as forces for good within the environment is explored herein by proposing a multi-sectoral analysis that accounts for nutrients, water, energy. The main purpose is to identify those elements in the urban system that can offer more opportunities of improvement with regard to ecoefficiency and eco-effectiveness indicators, and how different sectors, i.e. water, food, forestry, energy, and waste management, interact between each other. For this, (i) a computational model is designed using concepts of Substance Flow Analysis (SFA) together with mass and energy balances, and (ii) a set of indicators are defined to assess the improvement or worsening of the system. (iii) Both model and indicators are simulated under the Regionalized Sensitivity Analysis (RSA) framework to account of uncertainty and test the relevance of prospective technological innovations, i.e. structural changes.

abstract = {The resource shortages and environmental problems that cities face can be attributed to their increasing metabolic throughflow and their metabolic inefficiency. To support urban ecological management, it is necessary to identify the main metabolic actors responsible for these problems and analyze the characteristics of their metabolic structure. In this paper, we divide a typical urban metabolic system into seven components. Using material-flow analysis, we accounted for the amounts of resources and wastes transferred among the system's components and between the system and its environment, using Beijing from 1998 to 2007 as a case study. We used four indicators (metabolic scale, intensity, efficiency, and impact) to represent the inner structural characteristics of the urban metabolic system and analyzed the system based on the proposed indicators. The results provide scientific support for identifying the key metabolic actors responsible for urban metabolic disorders by accurately characterizing the city's metabolic status. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {For informed decision making about the current state and near future of any city, it is important to consider the long-term resource use trajectory and legacy of its past. Such information is not always readily available. Urban metabolism analysis for any given time period can be challenging due to the lack of metropolitan- or city-level data, and reconstructing a time series of urban energy or material flows is seldom attempted. For the case of Melbourne, Australia, we demonstrate how time series operational energy demand and supply data can be reconstructed from original sources. Primary energy consumption is calculated based on direct and upstream energy use in common with “scope 2” standards for emissions reporting. This extends the usual treatment of energy in urban metabolism studies by (1) providing time series data and (2) attributing upstream primary energy consumption to sectors based on their direct secondary energy usage. Results indicate that the transport, commercial, manufacturing, and residential sectors have contributed most to the doubling of Melbourne's energy consumption over four decades. We discuss recent urban development history and its relation to energy consumption and briefly examine potential scenarios of and responses to future change.},

Challenges with consistency and aggregation persist in the integration of urban models between socioeconomic and environmental systems, and between the micro and macro scale. Using an econometric model as a foundation offers a flexible structure, with low data requirements, that might potentially be integrated with microlevel process models. Such an econometric model is developed and verified for the economy of the Toronto region. The economic model is integrated with a greenhouse gas emission model that simulates emissions from the residential, transportation, and solid waste sectors. Emissions are simulated to 2010 for optimistic and pessimistic exogenous economic climates. In the absence of technological change, emissions will increase in the order of 30{\%}, largely as a result of population growth (22{\%}-23{\%}), which is relatively insensitive to economic growth. The potential to decrease emisisions through changing land-use development and increased recycling of solid waste is examined.},

Part of the urban carbon emission comes from residential energy consumption. Given the ongoing rapid urbanization and strict emission-reduction requirement, understanding the urban home energy usage carbon emission (UHEUCE) is of great importance to optimize the sustainability of social and economic developments in China. For this reason, a survey has been conducted to exam the condition of home energy usage in Xiamen Island, SE China. This study was based on 340 valid responses and a general linear model for univariate method. The analysis showed (1) among the residential building characteristics, window thermal insulation has the greatest effect on UHEUCE. (2) Construction age and wall thermal insulation could also influence UHEUCE in areas where summer is hot and winter is warm. The better heat prohibiting effect of external wall and window, as well as the newer construction, the more UHEUCE can be generated. The survey provided helpful first-hand data for design and planning on urban energy saving, emission reduction, and for relevant scientific researches. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {China's rapid urbanization has led to increasing steel consumption for buildings and civil engineering infrastructure. The in-use steel stock in the same is considered to be closely related to social welfare and urban metabolism. Traditional approaches for determining the in-use steel stock are labor-intensive and time-consuming processes and always hindered by the availability of statistical data. To address this issue, this study proposed the use of long-term nighttime lights as a proxy to effectively estimate in-use steel stock for buildings (IUSSB) and civil engineering infrastructure (IUSSCE) at the provincial level in China. Significant relationships between nighttime lights versus IUSSB and IUSSCE were observed for provincial variables in a single year, as well as for time series variables of a single province. However, these relationships were found to differ among provinces (referred to as “inter-individual differences”) and with time (referred to as “temporal differences”). Panel regression models were therefore proposed to estimate IUSSB and IUSSCE in consideration of the temporal and inter-individual differences based on a dataset covering 1992–2007. These models were validated using data for 2008, and the results showed good estimation for both IUSSB and IUSSCE. The proposed approach can be used to easily monitor the dynamic of IUSSB and IUSSCE in China. This should be critical in providing valuable information for policy making regarding regional development of buildings and infrastructure, sustainable urban resource management, and cross-boundary material recycling.},

abstract = {The interrelationships between energy and civilization was proposed in the late 19th century [see Martinez-Alier, J., 1987. Ecological Economics. Blackwell, Oxford]. Geddes [Geddes, P., 1915. City in Evolution. Williams and Norgate Ltd., London] also proposed the concept of linking energy flow with urban development in the early 20th century. Many recent studies of the relationship between urban development and energy have been limited to the use of fossil fuels; energy theories have seldom been used to study the evolution of urban systems. The purpose of this paper is to help develop theories of urban energetics and contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of urban development. We use the concepts from systems ecology [Odum, H.T., 1983. Systems Ecology. Wiley, New York] and emergy theory [Odum, H.T., 1996. Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making. Wiley, New York] to relate the driving energies of urban systems to their structure, economy and organization. Hypotheses of urban energetics including changes in the diversity of emergy sources, changes in urban metabolism, energy hierarchy, and relation between emergy and money flows are proposed and tested based on past research results on Taiwan cities (Huang, S.-L., Odum, H.T., Chang, S.-L., 1996.

Energy hierarchy and urban landscape system. Landscape Urban Plan. 53, 145-161]. Thereafter a system model of urban ecosystem is developed to investigate the relationships between energy flows and urban development. The preliminary findings of this research indicate that intensive and diversified emergy sources build up the structure and enhance metabolism in urban areas. Four mechanisms of urban energetics are also addressed as a result of simulations: energy convergence; urban-subsidized environmental flows; external-dependency system; maximum power system. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Urban metabolism research faces difficulties defining ecological trophic levels and analyzing relationships among the metabolic system's energy components. Here, we propose a new way to perform such research. By integrating throughflow analysis with ecological network utility analysis, we used network flows to analyze the metabolic system's network structure and the ecological relationships within the system. We developed an ecological network model for the system, and used four Chinese cities as examples of how this approach provides insights into the flows within the system at both high and low levels of detail. Using the weight distribution in the network flow matrix, we determined the structure of the urban energy metabolic system and the trophic levels; using the sign distribution in the network utility matrix, we determined the relationships between each pair of the system's compartments and their degrees of mutualism. The model uses compartments based on 17 sectors (energy exploitation; coal-fired power; heat supply; washed coal; coking; oil refinery; gas generation; coal products; agricultural; industrial; construction; communication, storage, and postal service; wholesale, retail, accommodation, and catering; household; other consuming; recovery; and energy stocks). Analyzing the structure and functioning of the urban energy metabolic system revealed ways to optimize its structure by adjusting the relationships among compartments, thereby demonstrating how ecological network analysis can be used in future urban system research. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A revised concept for urban water metabolism (UWM) is presented in this study to address the inadequacies in current research on UWM and the problems associated with the traditional urban water metabolic process. Feedback loops can be analyzed to increase the water environmental carrying capacity (WECC) of the new urban water metabolism system (UWMS) over that of a traditional UWMS. An analysis of the feedback loops of an UWMS was used to construct a system dynamics (SD) model for the system under a WECC restriction. Water metabolic processes were simulated for different scenarios using the Tongzhou District in Beijing as an example. The results for the newly developed UWM case showed that a water environment of Tongzhou District could support a population of 1.1926 × 106, an irrigation area of 375.521 km2, a livestock of 0.7732 × 106, and an industrial value added of ¥193.14 × 109 (i.e. about US{\$}28.285× 109) in 2020.

abstract = {We investigate different approaches to assessing the performance of multi-resource systems, i.e. networks of processes used to convert resource inputs to useful goods and services. For a given set of system outputs, alternative resource inputs are often possible so performance measures are needed to determine the best system configuration for a given goal. We define such performance measures according to a novel framework which categorises them into two types: those that can be calculated from a system's aggregate inputs and outputs ('black-box' metrics, e.g. carbon footprint); and those that require knowledge of resource conversion processes within the system ('grey-box' metrics). Urban areas are an important example application and metrics can be calculated from urban metabolism data. We calculate eight black-box metrics for fifteen global cities and find that performance is poorly correlated between the measures. This suggests that performance assessments should adopt grey-box approaches and consider flows at the level of individual processes within a city, using methods such as exergy analysis and ecological network analysis. We are led to suggest how to: (1) improve urban metabolism accounting to assist grey-box metric calculation, by including greater detail on conversion process and resource quality; and (2) promote these metrics amongst relevant decision makers.},

abstract = {In order to complete a life cycle assessment (LCA) study of the product, each activity interacting with the environment during the product life cycle should be given an explicit description, namely an LCA-oriented representation for the product life cycle should be constructed. A complex functional product usually consists of many parts made of different materials and its LCA-oriented life cycle modeling involves many complex semantic relationships. In this paper, a new LCA-oriented and ontology-based semantic representation model and methodology for the product life cycle are proposed. First, the concepts of processes and flows, and the semantic relationships among processes, and between processes and flows are analyzed in detail. The ontology classes of processes and flows are defined using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Then, an LCA-oriented semantic concept model for the product life cycle is presented. Based on the proposed semantic representation model, all processes, flows, and the relationships among them can be represented as a Resource Description Framework (RDF) graph in which each node is an instance tagged by an ontology class. A formalization of lifecycle processes on flows is provided, which can be encoded with Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) and formed into a knowledge rule base. In addition, a semantic query method for the life cycle inventory of a product is proposed. Finally, an implementation framework and an example of the semantic representation for a ball bearing's life cycle are provided.},

abstract = {Ontology learning aims at generating domain ontologies from various kinds of resources by applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques. It is inherent to the ontology learning process that the acquired ontologies represent uncertain and possibly contradicting knowledge. From a logical perspective, the learned ontologies are potentially inconsistent knowledge bases, that as such do not allow for meaningful reasoning. In this paper, we present an approach to generating consistent OWL ontologies from automatically generated or enriched ontology models, which takes into account the uncertainty of the acquired knowledge. We illustrate and evaluate the application of our approach with two experiments in the scenarios of consistent evolution of learned ontologies and enrichment of ontologies with disjointness axioms.},

abstract = {Through scenarios in the popular press and technical papers in the research literature, the promise of the Semantic Web has raised a number of different expectations. These expectations can be traced to three different perspectives on the Semantic Web. The Semantic Web is portrayed as: (1) a universal library, to be readily accessed and used by humans in a variety of information use contexts; (2) the backdrop for the work of computational agents completing sophisticated activities on behalf of their human counterparts; and (3) a method for federating particular knowledge bases and databases to perform anticipated tasks for humans and their agents. Each of these perspectives has both theoretical and pragmatic entailments, and a wealth of past experiences to guide and temper our expectations. In this paper, we examine all three perspectives from rhetorical, theoretical, and pragmatic viewpoints with an eye toward possible outcomes as Semantic Web efforts move forward.},

It gives a point of comparison with modern nation-wide material flow accounting. The aim is to test the feasibility of indicators of dematerialization of the economy in poor economies. We measured the annual material flows within the Sarowar village (670 inhabitants) in 1982-1983. The method was a combination of surveys, real time measurements, indirect measurements and laboratory dry matter measurements. The results were translated into recent concepts of material flow accounting (MFA), and compared with nation-wide studies. The total material requirement (TMR) of Sarowar (excluding air and water), USA, Japan, Germany and The Netherlands is respectively about 5, 84, 46, 86 and 84 tons per capita per year. The input (all biotic materials are expressed in tons dry matter) totalised 15.8 t DM cap-1 y-1 in Sarowar, which consists mainly of air (11 t cap-1 y-1) and biotic primary materials (4.1 t DM cap-1 y-1). The latest was composed of 29{\%} of pastures, 25{\%} of branches for field burning, 35{\%} of fuel wood, 6{\%} fodder, 1{\%} of construction wood and 4{\%} of grains. The outputs (15.8 t cap-1 y-1) were dominated by CO2 (15.1 t cap-1 y-1). In contrast, the output of The Netherlands (66.8 t cap-1 y-1) is dominated by export with air emissions (19 t cap-1 y-1), export (16 t cap-1 y-1) and embedded export (29 t cap-1 y-1). The apparent eco-efficiency (kg per US dollar, excluding air and water, including hidden flows) is 70, 3, 3, 3 and 3 kg {\$}-1 respectively for Sarowar, Japan, USA, Germany and The Netherlands. The corrected eco-efficiency using Purchasing Power Parity is less contrasted with respectively 18, 3, 3, 4 and 3 kg {\$}-1. Traditional human ecosystem measurements can serve as a basic comparison point, and as a test for dematerialization indicators. The limit of the indicator of eco-efficiency resides in the different degrees of monetization of the economies. In less monetized economies, this indicator is highly biased by the underlying non-market material flows. We discuss the use of ratios of non-substitutable factors in dematerialization assessment and we suggest the use of multi-criteria analysis instead. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Industrial ecology (IE) is an ambitious field of study where we seek to understand systems using a wide perspective ranging from the scale of molecules to that of the planet. Achieving such a holistic view is challenging and requires collecting, processing, curating, and sharing immense amounts of data and knowledge.We are not capable of fully achieving this due to the current state of tools used in IE and current community practices. Although we deal with a vastly interconnected world, we are not so good at efficiently interconnecting what we learn about it. This is not a problem unique to IE, and other fields have begun to use tools supported by the World Wide Web to meet these challenges.We discuss these sets of tools and illustrate how community driven data collection, processing, curation, and sharing is allowing people to achieve more than ever before. In particular, we discuss standards that have been created to allow for interlinking of data dispersed across multiple Web sites. This is currently visible in the Linking Open Data initiative, which among others contains interlinked datasets from the U.S. and U.K. governments, biology databases, and Wikipedia. Since the types of technologies and standards involved are outside the normal scope of work by many industrial ecologists, we attempt to explain the relevance, implications, and benefits through a discussion of many real examples currently on the Web.From these, we discuss several best practices, which can be enabling factors for how IE and the community can more efficiently and effectively meet its ambitions—an agenda for Industrial Ecology 2.0.},

The potential contributions of such data to the creation of new knowledge and downstream economic and social goods can in many cases be multiplied exponentially when the data are made openly available on digital networks. Most developed countries spend large amounts of public resources on research and related scientific facilities and instruments that generate massive amounts of data. Yet precious little of that investment is devoted to promoting the value of the resulting data by preserving and making them broadly available. The largely ad hoc approach to managing such data, however, is now beginning to be understood as inadequate to meet the exigencies of the national and international research enterprise. The time has thus come for the research community to establish explicit responsibilities for these digital resources.

abstract = {High-resolution, global quantification of fossil fuel CO2 emissions is emerging as a critical need in carbon cycle science and climate policy. We build upon a previously developed fossil fuel data assimilation system (FFDAS) for estimating global high-resolution fossil fuel CO2 emissions. We have improved the underlying observationally based data sources, expanded the approach through treatment of separate emitting sectors including a new pointwise database of global power plants, and extended the results to cover a 1997 to 2010 time series at a spatial resolution of 0.1°. Long-term trend analysis of the resulting global emissions shows subnational spatial structure in large active economies such as the United States, China, and India. These three countries, in particular, show different long-term trends and exploration of the trends in nighttime lights, and population reveal a decoupling of population and emissions at the subnational level. Analysis of shorter-term variations reveals the impact of the 2008–2009 global financial crisis with widespread negative emission anomalies across the U.S. and Europe. We have used a center of mass (CM) calculation as a compact metric to express the time evolution of spatial patterns in fossil fuel CO2 emissions. The global emission CM has moved toward the east and somewhat south between 1997 and 2010, driven by the increase in emissions in China and South Asia over this time period. Analysis at the level of individual countries reveals per capita CO2 emission migration in both Russia and India. The per capita emission CM holds potential as a way to succinctly analyze subnational shifts in carbon intensity over time. Uncertainties are generally lower than the previous version of FFDAS due mainly to an improved nightlight data set.},

abstract = {In order to advance the scientific understanding of carbon exchange with the land surface, build an effective carbon monitoring system, and contribute to quantitatively based U.S. climate change policy interests, fine spatial and temporal quantification of fossil fuel CO(2) emissions, the primary greenhouse gas, is essential. Called the "Hestia Project", this research effort is the first to use bottom-up methods to quantify all fossil fuel CO(2) emissions down to the scale of individual buildings, road segments, and industrial/electricity production facilities on an hourly basis for an entire urban landscape. Here, we describe the methods used to quantify the on-site fossil fuel CO(2) emissions across the city of Indianapolis, IN. This effort combines a series of data sets and simulation tools such as a building energy simulation model, traffic data, power production reporting, and local air pollution reporting. The system is general enough to be applied to any large U.S. city and holds tremendous potential as a key component of a carbon-monitoring system in addition to enabling efficient greenhouse gas mitigation and planning. We compare the natural gas component of our fossil fuel CO(2) emissions estimate to consumption data provided by the local gas utility. At the zip code level, we achieve a bias-adjusted Pearson r correlation value of 0.92 (p {\textless} 0.001).},

abstract = {Urban areas manage vast quantities of energy, water and waste resources. In order to minimise the cost and$\backslash$nenvironmental impact, optimisation modelling is often used in the design and operation of these systems. However,$\backslash$ntraditional modelling approaches only consider the energy, water and waste sectors in isolation. This approach$\backslash$nneglects the synergies possible between these systems whereby outputs from one system form an input to another,$\backslash$nand hence sets an upper bound on economic and environmental impact minimisation. We formulate a mixed integer$\backslash$nlinear programming (MILP) model which takes a ‘systems-of-infrastructure systems' approach to show how resource$\backslash$nconsumption can be reduced. The model takes as inputs possible resource conversion and transportation infrastructure$\backslash$nand resources, and resource demands, and returns the optimal infrastructure choice and layout. The model is called$\backslash$nPRaQ because it models ‘processes, resources and qualities.' We apply the model to the design of a new urban$\backslash$ndevelopment in China for three scenarios of various levels of resource integration. Results are still to be obtained.},

abstract = {The development of new system capabilities typically depends upon the prior success of advanced technology research and development efforts. These systems developments inevitably face the three major challenges of any project: performance, schedule and budget. Done well, advanced technology programs can substantially reduce the uncertainty in all three of these dimensions of project management. Done poorly, or not at all, and new system developments suffer from cost overruns, schedule delays and the steady erosion of initial performance objectives. It is often critical for senior management to be able to determine which of these two paths is more likely-and to respond accordingly. The challenge for system and technology managers is to be able to make clear, well-documented assessments of technology readiness and risks, and to do so at key points in the life cycle of the program. In the mid 1970s, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) introduced the concept of "technology readiness levels" (TRLs) as a discipline-independent, programmatic figure of merit (FOM) to allow more effective assessment of, and communication regarding the maturity of new technologies. In 1995, the TRL scale was further strengthened by the articulation of the first definitions of each level, along with examples (J. Mankins, Technology readiness levels, A White Paper, NASA, Washington, DC, 1995. [1]). Since then, TRLs have been embraced by the U.S. Congress' General Accountability Office (GAO), adopted by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), and are being considered for use by numerous other organizations. Overall, the TRLs have proved to be highly effective in communicating the status of new technologies among sometimes diverse organizations. This paper will review the concept of "technology readiness assessments", and provide a retrospective on the history of "TRLs" during the past 30 years. The paper will conclude with observations concerning prospective future directions for the important discipline of technology readiness assessments. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This article proposes a procedure for strategic technology scanning, an activity that has received insufficient attention in the literature to date. Strategic technology scanning is needed to strengthen the link between technology and corporate strategy. This link is ever present although not always explicitly managed. For instance, while it is commonly recognized that the corporate mission dictates the technological interests of the organization, it is not always sufficiently emphasized that it is the quality of technology foresight that shapes the corporate mission in the first place. Scanning enhances technology foresight by seeking major distinguishing features in the technological landscape. These features are termed landmark technologies and serve as indicators of evolving technological and economic potential. For the strategic manager landmark technologies can become focal points for understanding the external environment, very much as core competencies have become focal points for understanding the internal capabilities of the organization. The scanning procedure proposed here is tailored to fit conventional procedures for strategic planning. However, it employs new theoretical structures from the field of strategic technology analysis; and calls for involvement of all levels of the corporate hierarchy - from the corporate board to the technology analyst. It seeks to maximize corporate learning. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {Understanding Urban Metabolism addresses the gap between the bio-physical sciences and urban planning and illustrates the advantages of accounting for urban metabolism issues in urban design decisions. Urban metabolism considers a city as a system, and distinguishes between energy and material flows as its components. Based on research from the BRIDGE project, this book deals with how the urban surface exchanges and transforms energy, water, carbon and pollutants in cities. This book also introduces a new method for evaluating how planning alternatives can modify the physical flows of urban metabolism components and how environmental and socioeconomic components interact. The inclusion of sustainability principles into urban planning provides an opportunity to place the new knowledge provided by bio-physical sciences at the centre of the planning process, but there is a strong need to bridge knowledge and practice, as well as for a better dissemination of research results and exchange of best practice. This book meets that need and provides the reader with the necessary tools to integrate an understanding of urban metabolism into urban planning practice.},

abstract = {Understanding the drivers of energy and material flows of cities is important for addressing global environmental challenges. Accessing, sharing, and managing energy and material resources is particularly critical for megacities, which face enormous social stresses because of their sheer size and complexity. Here we quantify the energy and material flows through the world's 27 megacities with populations greater than 10 million people as of 2010. Collectively the resource flows through megacities are largely consistent with scaling laws established in the emerging science of cities. Correlations are established for electricity consumption, heating and industrial fuel use, ground transportation energy use, water consumption, waste generation, and steel production in terms of heating-degree-days, urban form, economic activity, and population growth. The results help identify megacities exhibiting high and low levels of consumption and those making efficient use of resources. The correlation between per capita electricity use and urbanized area per capita is shown to be a consequence of gross building floor area per capita, which is found to increase for lower-density cities. Many of the megacities are growing rapidly in population but are growing even faster in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) and energy use. In the decade from 2001–2011, electricity use and ground transportation fuel use in megacities grew at approximately half the rate of GDP growth.},

abstract = {As the world urbanizes, the role of cities in determining sustainability outcomes grows in importance. Cities are the dominant form of human habitat, and most of the world's resources are either directly or indirectly consumed in cities. Sustainable city analysis and management requires understanding the demands a city places on a wider geographical area and its ecological resource base. We present a detailed, integrated urban metabolism of residential consumption and ecological footprint analysis of the Vancouver metropolitan region for the year 2006. Our overall goal is to demonstrate the application of a bottom-up ecological footprint analysis using an urban metabolism framework at a metropolitan, regional scale. Our specific objectives are: a) to quantify energy and material consumption using locally generated data and b) to relate these data to global ecological carrying capacity. Although water is the largest material flow through Metro Vancouver (424,860,000m3), it has the smallest ecological footprint (23,100gha). Food (2,636,850 tonnes) contributes the largest component to the ecological footprint (4,514,400gha) which includes crop and grazing land as well as carbon sinks required to sequester emissions from food production and distribution. Transportation fuels (3,339,000m3) associated with motor vehicle operation and passenger air travel comprises the second largest material flow through the region and the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions (7,577,000 tonnes). Transportation also accounts for the second largest component of the EF (2,323,200gha). Buildings account for the largest electricity flow (17,515,150MWh) and constitute the third largest component of the EF (1,779,240gha). Consumables (2,400,000 tonnes) comprise the fourth largest component of the EF (1,414,440gha). Metro Vancouver's total Ecological Footprint in 2006 was 10,071,670gha, an area approximately 36 times larger than the region itself. The EFA reveals that cropland and carbon sinks (forested land required to sequester carbon dioxide emissions) account for 90{\%} of Metro Vancouver's overall demand for biocapacity. The per capita ecological footprint is 4.76gha, nearly three times the per capita global supply of biocapacity. Note that this value excludes national government services that operate outside the region and could account for up to an additional 2gha/ca. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The integrated study of energy and urban systems has recently become a critical component of sustainability research and policy. Increasing urbanization of human societies combined with intense energy demands of modern economies have driven a recognition that sustainable practices require a systems approach to both the study and application of sustainability principles. Urban metabolism has emerged as a leading methodology for quantifying energy consumption and use patterns in urban environments. Though typically applied as a method of accounting for total energy and materials inputs and outputs into cities, its interdisciplinary history and methods allow urban metabolism to be expanded in ways that will allow more comprehensive and integrated assessment of the patterns and processes of urban energy systems. In this article, we review the concept of urban metabolism-including its two typical approaches: mass balance and "emergy" methods-and offer a means to expand urban metabolism into a platform that incorporates socioeconomic analysis, policy analysis, and additional quantitative methodologies (such as life cycle assessment). This expanded urban metabolism framework is more comprehensive analytically and builds upon the documented capacity of traditional urban metabolism to account for total energy and materials flows of cities to provide an integrated platform for analysis of both energy patterns and the causal processes that govern energy in contemporary cities. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Urban metabolism considers a city as a system with flows of energy and material between it and the environment. Recent advances in bio-physical sciences provide methods and models to estimate local scale energy, water, carbon and pollutant fluxes. However, good communication is required to provide this new knowledge and its implications to endusers (such as urban planners, architects and engineers). The FP7 project BRIDGE (sustainaBle uRban plannIng Decision support accountinG for urban mEtabolism) aimed to address this gap by illustrating the advantages of considering these issues in urban planning. The BRIDGE Decision Support System (DSS) aids the evaluation of the sustainability of urban planning interventions. The Multi Criteria Analysis approach adopted provides a method to cope with the complexity of urban metabolism. In consultation with targeted end-users, objectives were defined in relation to the interactions between the environmental elements (fluxes of energy, water, carbon and pollutants) and socioeconomic components (investment costs, housing, employment, etc.) of urban sustainability. The tool was tested in five case study cities: Helsinki, Athens, London, Florence and Gliwice; and sub-models were evaluated using flux data selected. This overview of the BRIDGE project covers the methods and tools used to measure and model the physical flows, the selected set of sustainability indicators, the methodological framework for evaluating urban planning alternatives and the resulting DSS prototype. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Urban metabolism is a critical component of urban sustainability. On the basis of the driving force−pressure−state−response (DPSR) model and using material flow analysis, this article proposes a framework for sustainable urban management and policy assessment. A case study city in China, Suzhou, illustrates this framework. The results show that resource consumption (excluding water), water consumption, and waste generation (excluding carbon dioxide) in Suzhou after implementation of proposed policies will be 14{\%} lower than 2005 levels, 4.5{\%} higher, and 28.9{\%} higher, respectively, in 2015. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Suzhou will increase by 71.0{\%} in 2015 over 2005 levels, whereas carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product) will decrease by 44.9{\%}. Future pollution control in Suzhou should pay more attention to pollution from vehicles. In addition, goals for relative dematerialization of energy and decarbonization in Suzhou will be achieved before absolute ones are. In the short term, the urban metabolism of Suzhou in 2015 may meet corresponding urban objectives. In the longer term, however, reducing the city's resource demand and waste generation will pose challenges for the sustainability of Suzhou.},

Through calculating environmental and economic inputs within and outside the Beijing economy, this paper discusses the Beijing's resource structure, economic situation and trade status based on a series of emergy indicators. Through the comparison of the systematic indicators of Beijing with those of the selected Chinese cities, the general status of the Beijing economy in China is identified. The results also show that most indicators of Beijing are located at middle levels among the selected Chinese cities. Particularly, the environmental impacts, expressed by the ratio of waste to the renewable emergy, and the ratio of waste to the total emergy use, are 84.2 and 0.26, respectively in Beijing in 2004, which indicate that the Beijing economy is greatly reliant on the imported intensive fuels, goods and services with high empower density and environmental loading. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

During the past 20 years, Macao has experienced an economic boom accompanied by rapid social development, in which the gambling industry and related tourism services have become the main economic activity. This paper employs emergy flow analysis to investigate and characterize the evolution and development of Macao from 1983 to 2003. In addition, Macao has experienced six periods of land reclamation since 1866, supported by large-scale importation of sand and rocks from China. By simulating the emergy trends using the STELLA dynamic modeling software, we predicted the evolution of Macao's development and trends in the coming 20 years. In 2025, the city's economy is estimated to be 15 times its current size as a result of Macao's territorial expansion. The exported emergy will increase slowly and then stabilize, the population will reach 593 185, and the area covered by Macao will expand to 38.91 km2. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For the similarity across many emerging cities in China, a large-scale sub-urban residential area named Tian Tongyuan (TTY) in Beijing was chosen for testing the HEML. Objective indicators of live quality and negative impacts are both considered. Analysis indicates that the household Emergy input of TTY is 1.76E+16 sej/yr, while the prominent environmental impact is induced by Photochemical Oxidant Creation Potentials (POCP), 4.58E+05 g ethane eq./yr. The sustainable performance constructed by its live quality and environmental impacts of TTY is found as 98.80{\%} as that of Beijing average.

abstract = {Bringing about more sustainable consumption patterns is an important challenge for society and science. In this article the concept of household metabolism is applied to analyzing consumption patterns and to identifying possibilities for the development of sustainable household consumption patterns. Household metabolism is determined in terms of total energy requirements, including both direct and indirect energy requirements, using a hybrid method. This method enables us to evaluate various determinants of the environmental load of consumption consistently at several levels—the national level, the local level, and the household level. The average annual energy requirement of households varies considerably between the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Sweden, as well as within these countries. The average expenditure level per household explains a large part of the observed variations. Differences between these countries are also related to the efficiency of the production sectors and to the energy supply system. The consumption categories of food, transport, and recreation show the largest contributions to the environmental load. A comparison of consumer groups with different household characteristics shows remarkable differences in the division of spending over the consumption categories. Thus, analyses of different types of households are important for providing a basis for options to induce decreases of the environmental load of household consumption. At the city level, options for change are provided by an analysis of the city infrastructure, which determines a large part of the direct energy use by households (for transport and heating). At the national level, energy efficiency in production and in electricity generation is an important trigger for decreasing household energy requirements.},

abstract = {The cross-boundary environmental effects of urban household metabolism are of increasing interest in the context of global climate change and the sustainability of urban systems. To assess resource exchanges and environmental emissions, urban household metabolism was investigated using an 'emergy synthesis framework', with the city of Xiamen providing case study data. Two data sets, one from the highly urbanized Xiamen Island (XI) and the other from the less urbanized Xiamen Mainland (XM), were collected and analyzed using an 'urban spatial conceptual framework'. Household consumption and its spatial environmental effects are embodied by exchanges of resources, energy, services, and wastes between the urban system's physical footprint ('Urban Sprawl Region', USR), and its ecological footprint ('Urban Footprint Region', UFR). The results show that Xiamen's USR is connected to its UFRs by approximately 98.74{\%} emergy flows. The distinct emergy indicators identified within the results show that the driving forces, processes, influences, efficiency and sustainability of household metabolism vary dramatically between XI and XM, demonstrating that different urban and social contexts significantly affect household metabolism. The Emergy Sustainability Index reveals that USR households need to make lifestyles changes to sustain development. The employed frameworks (urban spatial conceptual framework and emergy synthesis framework) enable the computation of household consumption and cross-boundary environmental effects. The results may help foster alternative household consumption strategies which could result in more equitable resource allocation and effective mitigation of cross-boundary environmental influences. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The growing concern for energy, economy and environment calls for an efficient utilization of natural energy resources in developing useful work. An important thermodynamic aspect in gauging the overall energy economy of any physical process is the combined energy and exergy analysis from the identification of process irreversibilities. The present paper makes a comprehensive review pertaining to fundamental studies on thermodynamic irreversibility and exergy analysis in the processes of combustion of gaseous, liquid and solid fuels. The need for such investigations in the context of combustion processes in practice is first stressed upon and then the various approaches of exergy analysis and the results arrived at by different research workers in the field have been discussed. It has been recognized that, in almost all situations, the major source of irreversibilities is the internal thermal energy exchange associated with high-temperature gradients caused by heat release in combustion reactions. The primary way of keeping the exergy destruction in a combustion process within a reasonable limit is to reduce the irreversibility in heat conduction through proper control of physical processes and chemical reactions resulting in a high value of flame temperature but lower values of temperature gradients within the system. The optimum operating condition in this context can be determined from the parametric studies on combustion irreversibilities with operating parameters in different types of flames. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

By measuring water exchanges between different sectors of activity within the municipal borders, and considering underground and surface waters as natural components of this system, a network of flows is built and successively investigated by network analysis, a tool that is comprised in the apparatus of ecosystem ecology. By calculating the reciprocal dependence of compartments, the amount of resource that is involved in cycling, the length of exchange pathways, and the organisation of flows, network analysis shows that the system does not use water in a sustainable manner and provides general criteria for improving sustainability. In this respect, options to improve sustainability are also discussed. The results of this study support the idea that the ecosystem approach can provide an interesting conceptual perspective in which sustainability issues can be framed, and that network analysis is a promising tool to handle these issues in practice.},

Total system throughflow (TST) is defined as the sum of all compartmental throughflows. Average path length of the ith inflow (APL1) is defined as the average number of compartments through which the ith inflow passes. Average path length for an average inflow (ĀPL) is the mean of APL1 weighted according to size of the inflows. ĀPL is shown to be equal to TST divided by the sum of all inflows. TST can be partitioned into a portion due to cycled flow (TSTo) and a portion due to flow straight through the system (straight throughflow, TSTs). The portion of ĀPL due to cycled flow divided by the portion due to straight throughflow is the cycling index (CI). This index indicates how many times further than the straight throughflow path length an average system inflow will travel because of cycling. Three simple ecosystem models are examined to demonstrate the utility of these measures in explaining ecological phenomena. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

abstract = {The exergy method has been used to analyse changes in the structure of the UK energy system over a period of more than 30 years from 1965. A sectoral approach was employed, with the supply side examined in terms of the main energy sources, while final demand was separated into four energy end-use groups: the domestic, service, industrial and transport sectors. Estimates of sector-weighted or 'lumped' parameters, such as exergy efficiencies, were obtained from the particular characteristics of each sector. These were employed to determine the exergetic 'improvement potential' for critical elements of the energy system. Electricity generation together with final energy demand in the domestic sector and in transport are shown to account for nearly 80 per cent of the Second Law improvement potential. This poor thermodynamic performance is principally due to exergy losses in combustion and heat transfer processes associated with power generation, space heating and main transport modes. The results of the exergy analysis are placed in the context of recent developments in energy market liberalization and of the need to achieve environmental sustainability. They are also contrasted with proposals for new or improved energy technologies to meet the requirements of a sustainable energy strategy. Finally, the role of the exergy method is contrasted with the various other approaches to energy technology assessment.},

abstract = {The Economic Energy Intensity of a country, defined as the ratio between the energy consumed and the Gross Domestic Product of a country, is a widely-adopted indicator of economic performance, often applied to sustainability analysis. The usefulness of this indicator has been challenged on the basis of the fact that the two variables making up this ratio are correlated. This implies that, when considered in isolation, each one of these two variables (Energy Consumption p.c. and GDP p.c.) maps on to typologies of socio-economic systems (e.g. developed countries vs. less developed countries), however calculating their ratio produces an indicator which does not map on to any meaningful typology of economic system (a number without an external referent). This paper checks the validity of this criticism by looking at the Economic Energy Intensity (EEI) of 133 countries over the period 1960-2009. Two approaches are used for this task: (1) an analysis at a given point in time (year 2009): after excluding countries with real GDP p.c.{\textless}5000 US{\$} I considered three clusters of countries with similar values of EEI. Within each cluster, when looking at similar values of EEI, we find extremely diverse typologies of economies; (2) a video showing the movement in time of 133 countries between 1960 and 2010 over the plane determined by the two variables composing the indicator. These results confirm the doubts about both the meaning and usefulness of the indicator itself. In particular this analysis indicates that the problems with the EEI indicator are generated by the attempt to compress into a single number different pieces of information referring to different dimensions (monetary and energy flows) and to different scales (the characteristics of the whole country are determined by the specific characteristics of different sectors). ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Virtual water as the overall water consumption of a building includes not only the on-site water use for constructing and operating, but also the off-site water used to supply the necessary manpower, material and equipment inputs required by the building. This paper advances a systematic virtual water accounting framework for building by employing a hybrid method as the combination of both process and input-output analysis. Based on the raw project data in the Bill of Quantities, a detailed case study is performed for the structure engineering of six landmark buildings in E-town, Beijing, supported by the virtual water intensity database for the Chinese economy in 2007. The total virtual water of the case buildings is quantified as 1.25E+06 m3, corresponding to an intensity of 20.83 m3 per square meter floor area. On-site tap-water supply, material inputs and manpower inputs contribute to 43.55{\%}, 50.05{\%} and 6.31{\%} of the virtual water, respectively, indicating the fact that off-site water use plays a critical role in balancing the overall water budget of a building. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Reduction of costs incurred for supplying water and heating it for household purposes is possible by means of an application of systems recovering heat from drain water in combination with water flow limiters. Then, not only advantageous financial results can be obtained, but also positive effects in the form of reduced use of fossil fuels, improved air quality, and limited water consumption. This paper presents a calculation model that allows to assess the synergy of financial effects for different variants of an investment project consisting in mounting a water flow limiter and a DWHR unit in a shower system of a single-family building. This model has a large application potential that can be used as a tool facilitating the decision-making process both in the system design and modernization stage. A simulation test carried out for the case study involving different variants of modernization of a household shower system shows that profitability of such investment depends on the adopted modernization variant and system usage parameters. The best financial performance characterizes variants involving the use of a water flow limiter or both devices. The mounting of both devices becomes the most advantageous when the shower taking time is long. The obtained results additionally show that the most favorable financial effects can be achieved in buildings in which the total time of using shower facilities is the longest. The application of the presented solutions will be, therefore, particularly profitable in case of buildings characterized with significant water consumption and high rotation of users. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A key factor deciding the capacity to increase the sustainability of final products is the energy efficiency. The energy embodied in a product is an aggregation of all of the energy embodied in the products' components and subsystems, expended through its manufacturing processes and logistical activities. Currently, accurate estimation of this energy metric is hindered due to the unavailability of energy use data traceable to individual processes and equipment associated with the product's assembly. In this paper, we propose using minimally-required energy to compute energy efficiency of a product assembly process. Based on the proposed approach, efficiency metrics established on the process, product, material and equipment characteristics have been presented at the assembly activity and equipment level. A case study has been presented for a hybrid laser welding process to demonstrate the computational methods used to arrive at these efficiency metrics. Major contributions of this paper are the metrics development and exemplifying the metrics through an actual assembly process (hybrid laser welding) case study. We will explain how these metrics can provide industries with a capability to identify opportunities to improve their sustainability performance across their assembly processes.},

abstract = {Environmental variables are increasingly being used in decision-making. An important way to generate environmental information involves Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), methodology that measures the environmental impacts of a product throughout its life cycle. Parallel to this, Wackernagel and Rees developed a methodology to assess the environmental sustainability of regions, the Ecological Footprint (EF) method. Recently, this methodology has also been applied to product evaluations. It is believed that there are differences in the interpretation of the results when using the EF method compared to LCA methods. Therefore, the objective of this work was to compare the different interpretation that can be obtained from CML 2001 and EF, using a case study of four scenarios of broiler feed production in Brazil. The inventory was collected with secondary data, and the main difference among the four scenarios was the origin of the maize and soybeans used (the center-west and south regions of Brazil). As a result, the worst scenario (with maize and soybeans from the center-west) and the best scenario (with maize and soybeans from the south) were the same for both methods, although the second and the third rankings were different. Additionally, we observed that different hotspots were identified. CML (modified) and EF were similar from a broad point of view, but higher differences emerged between them when a deeper analysis was considered. We conclude that the use of EF is not suitable for the agricultural sector, since misleading decisions can be taken as a result of neglecting some important environmental impacts (e.g.: eutrophication and acidification) for this economic sector. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this study we investigate how indicators for energy use are applied in a set of life cycle assessment (LCA) and energy analysis case studies of biofuels. We found five inherently different types of indicators to describe energy use: (1) fossil energy, (2) secondary energy, (3) cumulative energy demand, (4) net energy balance, and (5) total extracted energy. It was also found that the examined reports and articles, the choice of energy use indicator was seldom motivated or discussed in relation to other energy use indicators. In order to investigate the differences between these indicators, they were applied to a case. The life cycle energy use of palm oil methyl ester was calculated and reported using these five different indicators for energy use, giving considerably different output results. This is in itself not unexpected, but indicates the importance of clearly identifying, describing and motivating the choice of energy use indicator. The indicators can all be useful in specific situations, depending on the goal and scope of the individual study, but the choice of indicators need to be better reported and motivated than what is generally done today. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The content underscores the recognition of the pressing and inescapable need for making changes from unsustainable to sustainable production and consumption patterns. The 48 articles from 15 countries provide different, but complimentary approaches to help industrial and societal sectors in advancing on their paths towards sustainability. Initiatives and challenges are included, which systematically address problems affecting raw material changes, technological modifications, product and policy changes. The findings range from proposals for alternative uses of wastes, substitution of raw materials for environmentally friendlier substances, optimization of industrial processes by source reductions of wastes and emissions and documented economic and environmental advantages of a wide array of initiatives. The roles of operational and managerial practices are also stressed, highlighting the role of diverse stakeholders as promoters of implementation and internalization of innovative cleaner technologies within companies. Systemic assessment tools are employed and experimented with in order to more effectively evaluate the environmental performance of systems on the biosphere scale. The methodological procedures and proposals presented can help in the design and management of production systems, for governmental and corporate policy development, for implementing and monitoring CP Programs, prevention and mitigation strategies, and evaluation of the outcomes of CP initiatives in the production and service sectors. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This issue of the Journal of Cleaner Production is based upon papers presented at the 1st International Workshop Advances in Cleaner Production (CP) held in S??o Paulo, Brazil, in 2007. The conference had the short-term purpose of deepening the Brazilian discussion on "The Roles of Cleaner Production in the Sustainable Development of Modern Societies", and it had the long-term objective of providing an on-going interdisciplinary forum for knowledge development and exchange on Cleaner Production (CP) and Sustainable Development. This issue is devoted to papers covering a broad range of perspectives of CP practices and strategies. A special focus is placed upon methodological tools designed to support effective decision-making pertaining to quantitative benefits from CP. The ten papers provide insights from research designed to holistically integrate CP to help society make effective progress to sustainability. Papers cover the importance of informal knowledge, as complementary to formal knowledge, in performing effective 'Environmental Impact Assessments.' One paper explores the roles of radical and incremental innovation in the context of alternative automotive technologies. Benefits of Ecodesign are explored in two papers; one concerning its integration with remanufacturing to extend the life of used products and one focusing the adoption of 'Emergy Environmental Accounting,' as a complementary decision-making tool. The development of the Brazilian LCI database for 'hydroelectric power generation' and its contribution to support regionally relevant LCA studies is highlighted in one paper. The complete production chains of biodiesel and bioethanol are evaluated by using global methodologies, which help in the development of more objective and effective solutions. A "compensatory area", calculated in terms of emergy, is proposed in order to work in a sustainable way for bamboo production. Finally, a paper about a novel approach for recycling used PET is also included. ?? 2009.},

abstract = {This paper aims to measure raw material inputs and waste flows in an Irish city-region in order to analyse (i) whether there was absolute dematerialisation in the particular case study over the period 1992-2002 and (ii) whether material consumption and waste generation were decoupled from economic growth and increases in disposable income over the same period. It was found that the selected material flow indicators showed no evidence of absolute dematerialisation over the given study period, although more recent evidence at the national level suggests that a decline in construction activity and extraction of non-metallic minerals has resulted in an absolute reduction in material consumption and it is likely that this will be mirrored at the system boundary level. It was found that Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) per capita and Direct Material Input (DMI) per capita increased at a faster rate than Domestic Processed Output (DPO) per capita and Direct Material Output (DMO) per capita between 1992 and 2002, which indicates relative decoupling of consumption from waste generation. In addition, it was found that there was relative decoupling of consumption and waste generation from disposable income growth over the study period. Finally, it was found that average DMC and DMI figures for the selected case study were lower than the national averages but broadly similar to results for other city-regions in the European Union (EU). On a methodological note, it was concluded that material flow accounting (MFA) for city-regions in Ireland is constrained due to a lack of disaggregated data for material flows, with the exception of local waste data, and it is recommended that bottom-up analysis should be used to complement disaggregated top-down data. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Ecosystem theory has been developed during recent decades, thereby a series of concepts are hypothesized to describe principles inherent to the "natural" function of biological systems at various levels of hierarchy. It seems that a universal trend exists, through evolutionary time and space that allows us to establish indicators that may be used to observe patterns in evolution, even at high levels of hierarchy such as the ecosystem level. The functional principles of ecosystems have evolved over a period of time corresponding to the existence of life on earth say 3-4 billion years. The obvious question immediately arises whether we could learn something from observing these principles. Could we possibly improve our existence by living in accordance with these principles practiced in nature, as exemplified by ecosystems? In this paper, a comparison between natural systems on the one side and industrial-societal systems on the other side is made using 10 target areas as entrance points. It turns out that even though industrial ecologists are aware of and are practicing some points in ecosystem theory, far from all principles, have been exploited. It is suggested that society should increase attention to some of the features where natural systems and societal systems differ greatly. It is hypothesized that industry and society, both in terms of economy and sustainability, would benefit from exploiting these natural principles, even more. This would lead to an intended and deliberate development of the industrial sectors and society in general accordance with the natural ecosystem principles. This led the author to propose the eco-mimetic development of our society. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {With the growing environmental concern, there is evidence that increasing symbiotic relationship between plants in the same industrial area, highly contributes to a more sustainable development of industrial activities. The concept of industrial ecology extended to the terms of eco-industrial park (or ecopark) or industrial symbioses is the topic of extensive research since the five last years. More particularly, even if a lot of ecopark examples and realizations already exist throughout the world, a lot of ecopark proposals are in progress but not achieved. Recently, this vision leads the research community to focus on works proposing methods to optimize the exchanges of an ecopark prior to its design and construction. We find it especially interesting for the scientific community to propose a detailed paper review focused on optimization works devoted to the design of eco industrial parks. This paper is based on a comprehensive literature search in Web of Science database for publications that listed 'industrial symbiosis' (or 'eco industrial park', or 'inter plant integration') and 'optimization'. This study is segmented into different sections with first, a description of the different concepts evoked in the literature. Then, the several types of networking in an eco-industrial park are detailed in association with the optimization methods employed to solve each problem. The following sections reviews the different objective functions that are formulated to optimally design an eco-industrial park. The last part of the paper is devoted to a critical analysis of the state of the art by proposing several routes to improve the methodologies found in the literature. Another aim of this paper review consists in finding the gaps existing in previous studies. These major gaps are found to be: The lack of multiobjective optimization studies, the absence of social/societal objectives formulation also needs to be addressed and the lack of works taking into account flexibility of ecoparks in an operational point of view.},

abstract = {Increasing population, booming economy, rapid urbanization and the rise in community living standards have significantly accelerated the solid waste generation in the world. Solid waste has become one of the global environmental issues. Continuous depletion of natural finite resources is leading the globe to an uncertain future. To prevent further depletion of global resources, sustainable consumption and a strategic waste management system would be required. One approach that has been suggested as a means of addressing these concerns is that of the concepts of “Zero Waste”. However, transforming currently over-consuming activities into zero waste is still challenging. In this study, the challenges of solid waste (focusing on industrial waste e-waste, food waste and packaging waste), zero waste practices, and zero waste strategy were discussed to analyze the challenges and opportunities to transform traditional waste management toward zero waste vision. “Zero Waste” is a good solution to minimizing the increasing solid waste. However, in order to minimize the solid waste, there are still more endeavors need to be done in future.},

Due to a short projected term of availability of the copper, zinc and lead resources (20e30 years) and unavoidable consumption of primary energy (oil, coal, natural gas) the problem of efficiency and economics of the currently used and future technologies is important. It is important that the metallurgy industry is efficient because it can be a significant contribution to Gross National Product and energy consumption in countries where metal production occurs. For example, to get the maximum value from copper deposits, the proper and most efficient technology (of many) should be chosen. The authors proposed a minimum value of Cumulative Exergy Consumption (CExC) as the criterion for the recommended technology. Based on this criterion we conclude that, for example, pure copper cathode production by flash smelting technology is the best technology.},

abstract = {Abstract Shandong Province's Lubei eco-industrial park was established early, developed well, and began earning high profits, and has been recognized around the world as a successful example of this type of park. Previous research on the metabolic processes for the elements that flow through eco-industrial parks has mainly accounted for the flows, stocks, and utilization efficiency of a few elements, but few studies have analyzed the complex internal characteristics of these metabolic processes by combining their structural and functional attributes. In this study, we analyzed the delivery and transformation processes and the internal characteristics of the industrial metabolic processes for sulfur in the Lubei eco-industrial park. By using network analysis, we were able to analyze the structural and functional characteristics of this network from the perspective of nodes (members of the network) and paths (flows between the nodes), and by combining an assessment of the characteristics of the nodes (degree, betweenness, closeness) and the paths (flow quantities and directions), we identified the key node (the cement clinker production), peripheral nodes (the ammonia and power plants), and key paths in the network (from the sulfuric acid plant to the ammonium phosphate plant, from the cement clinker production to the sulfuric acid plant, and from the ammonium phosphate plant to the cement clinker production). These results reveal the advantages and disadvantages of the Lubei eco-industrial park in terms of its structure and function, and suggest ways to improve the efficiency and the sustainable development of the park.},

Various other technologies have been proposed as alternatives to the historically preferred Waelz Kiln process. This gate-to-gate study presents an objective method to compare the overall thermodynamic performance and efficiency of treatment technologies through the use of an exergy analysis incorporating the dominant factors without the need of examining every process detail. In addition, the influence of the EAFD zinc content on the exergy efficiency of both the Waelz Kiln and Rotary Hearth Furnace process was studied.

abstract = {With the rapid urbanization, many cities are facing various environmental issues, resulting in local ecological degradation. It is critical to conduct a scientific assessment so that appropriate solutions can be found by considering the local realities. Many evaluation methods, such as emergy analysis, material flow analysis, data envelopment analysis and ecological footprint analysis, have been proposed. Among them, ecological footprint analysis has been applied as a useful policy and planning tool for evaluating urban sustainability. The aim of this paper is to evaluate two industrial cities by using ecological footprint method in Shenyang, China and Kawasaki, Japan. The two cities have been "friendship cities" for over 30 years and have similar industrial structures. In order to present a holistic evolution picture on their ecological footprints, we collected all the relevant data for the period of 1997-2009. The results show that Shenyang's ecological footprints experienced a significant increase, while such figures in Kawasaki were quite stable, but per capita figures in Shenyang were much less than those in Kawasaki, indicating that a gap between the two cities still exist. In order to further improve its sustainable development, Shenyang should closely collaborate with Kawasaki, learning Kawasaki's eco-town experiences and other environmental management experiences. In addition, Shenyang should also learn from other leading cities and try to optimize its industrial and energy structure and improve their citizens' environmental awareness so that it can move toward a more sustainable development direction. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The housing sector has a big environmental impact and it makes a good candidate for changes to be implemented in order to make steps towards a sustainable society. This study deals with the exergy analysis and the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of solar systems for space heating, cooling and hot domestic water production. These systems will be applied to a residence in the wide Thessaloniki area, in Northern Greece. The analysis is based on the given energy needs of an average house. Furthermore, a photovoltaic system (PV) will be used for electricity production. Besides Solar energy, the existing geothermal field will be utilized via heat pumps. The system is designed to exploit solar and geothermal energy and an exergy analysis of the different elements of the system is performed so that improvements can be achieved in its efficiency and its cost be reduced. It has been shown that the exergy efficiency of the solar systems and the geothermal system are relatively low. Since almost all of the environmental impacts of the renewable energies are connected to the manufacturing of the devises for their utilization, the environmental impacts will be analyzed only at the manufacturing stage. The use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) will be used. It has been shown that the use of solar cooling has the highest environmental impact. This analysis applies for all regions since the energy needs could be adjusted and the solar radiation of that region taken into consideration. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Economic Order Quantity, EOQ, model has been popular among academicians and practitioners for decades. Despite the many variants of the EOQ that have appeared in the literature to fine-tune it to reality, it still has limitations. A major one is that it does not take into account the hidden costs inherent in inventory systems. Some of these costs relate to sustainability issues including environmental, social labor, and economic effects.This paper considers some of these costs, referred to as the exergetic costs, and estimates them using the Extended Exergy Accounting, EEA, approach. Extended Exergy Accounting assigns equivalent exergetic values to capital, labor and environmental remediation costs of a system. The analysis combines the classical exergy analysis with the sustainability factors, which are the labor, capital and environment. The paper uses an exergetic model to determine the EOQ inventory policies for three firms operating in the USA, Germany and China. The results show that the EOQ is different for the three firms because the equivalent exergy of capital, labor and environment remediation costs is different in each country. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract The Danish island Sams?? has since 1997 initiated a process through which the island should reach a state where it would be able to supply its own energy. Such a situation was reached since 2005 - after having established 21 windmills - and the island is now a net exporter of electricity to the Danish power network. At the same time the buildings in the more habituated areas were connected to 4 district heating plants which generate heat from combustion of straw in some cases combined with supplementary inputs from photo thermal devices. Meanwhile, certain activities on the island, such as running the ferries, cars, factories and heating in more distant areas are still dependent on significant input of fossil fuels. The inhabitants have recently stated a wish to move on towards being independent of fossil fuels in 2030 and carbon neutral during the next decades. As a consequence the idea came up to develop a method for the "sustainability analysis" of a society which would assist in governing the transitional process in the direction of increasing sustainability. Therefore, a framework has been developed based on the concept exergy that may reveal where large consumptions are taking places. Such areas are likely to be sensible targets for action or at least increased attention. Basic methods have been developed that allows to account for infrastructure, transfers, inputs and outputs, and consumption in terms of exergy, and taking into account whether the exergy storages or flows can be considered to be renewable or not. The framework has been developed for six societal sectors: the energy sector, the public sector, the private households, the agricultural sector, the industry, commerce and trade sector and nature. Nature is here considered an activity that provides the society with an exergy that may also be of value to our societies, often referred to as ecosystem services. Based on the estimated amount of infrastructure and transfers, inputs and outputs a number of "sustainability indicators" have been developed that may be monitored over time and which may serve to indicate whether potential measures undertaken also lead the society in the right direction. An attempt to evaluate the potential importance of wastes has also been carried out as in organic waste could play an important role in acquiring the amount of bio-diesel required to run the ferries in the future. The results demonstrate that the already existing overhead in production of electricity leaves the island with many options and a great opportunity to be independent of fossil fuels in near future. In fact, it might well be that socio-economical perspectives will turn out to be the more severe obstacles in the transition process. Adjacent to this work a carbon model has also been set up to reveal the consequence of proposed measures and strategies to the carbon budget of the island (J??rgensen and Nielsen, 2014).},

abstract = {Promoting the recovery of waste produced by companies in urban areas through Inter-firm relations such as Industrial Symbiosis, Resource Recovery or In-House Reuse can be seen as good approaches to achieve materials loop closure and foster self-reliance (resilience), by decreasing dependence of external sources. In this article the industrial waste produced in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA) during 2008 is assessed. By applying a Material Flow Analysis methodology, the research identifies the amount of waste that was recovered as well as the Recovery Networks that each transaction is integrated in. Additionally, it was performed an identification of the composition of the waste disposed and the results were computed against a database of waste recovery cases worldwide. Possible recovery solutions of the disposed waste were identified and proposals of improvement of the recovery network are advanced. Results show that a high amount of waste produced by the companies located in the LMA was recovered (791,086 tonnes from the 1,000,091 tonnes of generated waste). The Resource Recovery network processed 43{\%} of the wastes, In-house reuse, 34{\%}, and Industrial Symbiosis, 23{\%}. The recovery solutions identified for the disposal waste show that at least 68{\%} of the 209,005 tonnes disposed could also be recovered, increasing the total amount for Industrial wasted recovered from 79{\%} to 94{\%}. The performance of the waste recovery network in this region supports the results of previous researches and uncovers new behavioural characteristics, namely when comparing Industrial Symbiosis and Resource Recovery.},

However, related studies on virtual water are yet far from enough to comprehensively quantify the real water balance of cities. The gap between direct water input and real water demand of a city is demonstrated in the present study by a case study for Macao in the past decade after the sovereignty handover. With the latest virtual water intensity databases, the virtual water embodied in external trade is systematically analyzed. For virtual water embodied in goods, mainland China holds the position as Macao's biggest importer, and the USA outpaces Hong Kong to be the biggest exporter. Virtual water embodied in gaming service dominates that of exported services while household final consumption expenditure abroad contributes the largest share of virtual water embodied in imported services. Despite of fluctuation, virtual water consumed by Macao has increased by about 1.5 folds. As a typical net virtual water importer, Macao has a heavy dependency over 99{\%} on external water resources. Per capita virtual water consumption of Macao is similar to that of developed countries. The comparatively low virtual water intensity is in accordance with the reality of a service dominated economy.},

abstract = {Water is required for mining and mineral processing operations. In recent years, the mining industry is facing increasing water demand and increasing competition with other water users. Hence, mine water systems need to be well managed to ensure water is reliably available for mining operations. Energy is required for almost all water processes, such as pumping, treatment, cooling and heating. The management of a mine water system is related to energy use. For strategic mine water management, information about the energy demand directly related to different water management options is usually required to assist in the decision-making process of selecting suitable water management options. This research presents the application of an exergy analysis technique named 'Physical Hydronomics' to show critical factors affecting the energy demand of water management options. The analysis identifies focus points where additional energy demand can be reduced or avoided when upgrading a water system. At the same time, energy demand of different water options isalso quantified. The method is demonstrated by assessing the energy demand of three water desalination options of a coal mine. The aim of introducing these water options to the mine is to improve water use efficiency. The exergy analysis technique generates exergy profiles of water flows and presents critical factors related to the energy demand of water flows. At the end of the analysis, total exergy demand of each of the three water desalination options is estimated.},

abstract = {This study evaluates direct and indirect environmental impacts associated with the consumption of goods and services by the households living in the municipality of Aveiro (Portugal) using environmentally extended input output (IO) analysis. The environmental impacts addressed are greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil fuel consumption. A methodology adapted to the specificities of the data available is proposed. This methodology relies on the Portuguese economic IO table, on GHG emission and fossil fuel consumption intensities, and on national household expenditure data downscaled to the urban level. This methodology could also be applied to other municipalities or cities for which data on local household expenditures are missing. This study also identifies the sectors with the largest impacts in order to prioritise strategies for reducing the impacts to move the municipality towards more sustainable consumption. The estimated total GHG emissions in 2005 amounted to 26 kg CO2-eq./cap/day and the total fossil fuel consumption was 7.3 koe/cap/day. The sectors that contributed most for both indicators are "land transport and transport by pipelines", "food, beverages and tobacco", "construction" and "production, collection and distribution of electricity". Therefore, improvement measures are proposed for these sectors in order to more effectively decrease the environmental impacts related with GHG emissions and fossil energy consumption of the municipality. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this study, energy and exergy analyses of new geothermal energy based multi-generation systems with seven different combinations for practical applications are performed. The systems considered are mainly examined under two distinct main groups for heating and cooling periods. In this regard, detailed work flow charts and tables are prepared for each energy system studied. Energy and exergy analyses are conducted, and their respective efficiencies are determined for the whole systems and their components. These efficiencies are then compared for performance assessment and cleaner production. Improvement potentials for every system component and the overall system are calculated and compared. Four performance-related parameters, namely energetic renewability rate, exergetic renewability rate, system energetic reinjection rate and system exergetic reinjection rate are investigated. The analysis results show that overall system energy and exergy efficiency are increased by 3.40 and 1.12 times for cooling season and about 4.25 and 1.25 times for heating season, as compared to the single power generating option. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Industrial ecology (IE) has been characterized by a fragmented approach encompassing a number of different perspectives and analytical techniques. A uniform framework has yet to be established or proposed. This paper partially addresses this shortcoming by tracing some of the historical and intellectual antecedents of the field, providing a clear and concise lexicon of the biological analogue, and contrasting the two most promising analytical methods by which IE research may be carried out: life cycle assessment (LCA) and systems analysis. Although a number of comparative environmental metrics may be employed in cost-minimization or thermodynamic efficiency studies, no single measure is sufficiently developed to prioritize among qualitatively disparate types of environmental impacts. It is argued herein that the concept of chemical exergy of mixing may be the most promising basis for the development of a uniform, broad-based measure of chemical pollution, and that such a measure could significantly advance a scientific approach to IE. Some theoretical background is presented, although the reasoning herein is intended to be accessible to an interdisciplinary audience. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Zero waste is a visionary concept for confronting waste problems in our society. The idea is being developed and implemented in various sectors including waste management and treatment, mining, manufacturing, and urban development. The zero waste concept has been embraced by policymakers because it stimulates sustainable production and consumption, optimum recycling and resource recovery. Professionals in waste management systems, however, perceive and apply it in different ways. This study aims to conceptualize zero waste development based on a critical review of available academic journal publications. Very few studies have been found in the domains of zero waste design, assessment and evaluation that have examined production, and sustainable consumption. This study reveals that the scope of the zero waste studies is diverse, and a zero waste concept is constantly developing through various programmes, plans, policies and strategies. The findings of this review study suggest that the zero waste programmes are applied in many countries without any holistic zero waste strategy. The study emphasizes that countries might be able to achieve zero waste goals by developing a national zero waste strategy and by integrating and promoting zero waste initiatives (in communities and industry) through waste management policy. This article presents a critical review of the major studies conducted by researchers on zero waste in the last decades. Based on the review findings the study concludes that zero waste concept has been applied widely in different phases of production and waste management systems. The findings of the study assist to identify priority areas of zero waste strategy and to develop national zero waste guidelines. Thus, this study can be useful to policy and decision makers in developing the evidence-based zero waste guidelines.},

abstract = {Based on urban metabolism theory, urban energy consumption and carbon emission can be analyzed and the urban energy structure and carbon metabolic processes can be specified. By combining input-output analysis with ecological network analysis, the embodied energy and carbon footprint implied in urban products and services can be quantified. On this basis, we introduced energy structure indices based on the embodied energy per unit carbon emitted (i.e., the emission efficiency), which we used to evaluate the energy structure attributes of the metabolic actors. This approach provides a scientific basis for energy conservation and carbon emission reduction. Beijing is trying to control pollution (especially the smog produced by coal combustion), and this task is complicated by its large metabolic fluxes and strong metabolic influence. In this study, we analyzed the energy consumption structure of 28 sectors in Beijing from the perspective of their carbon footprint, and divided the sectors into four categories based on the relationship between their embodied energy consumption and the emission efficiency. We found that most sectors had high energy consumption and low emission efficiency, and that from 2000 to 2010, Beijing's overall consumption structure alternated between high and low embodied energy per unit of carbon emission, but the overall trend of emission efficiency changed toward higher. The insights provided by our analysis reveal ways to reduce carbon emission. Based on the carbon footprints of the 28 sectors, we propose how managers could adjust its energy consumption structure to decrease energy consumption and carbon emission.},

abstract = {The evaluation of the environmental sustainability of a technological option requires the consideration of the complete product life cycle. By using the methodology of a classical environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), it is possible to analyze the environmental problems of the sugar industry through all stages of the full process including different options for the by-products valorization. Exergy and exergetic life cycle analysis are much more resource and product, and hence also efficiency, oriented. The Cumulative Exergy Consumption (CExC) has the advantage that different kinds of resources are quantified on one single scale, which is a unique feature in resource accounting. In this work, Exergetic Life Cycle Assessment was combined with a traditional LCA of cane sugar production process developed previously by Contreras et al. (Contreras et al., 2009), for assessing four different alternatives for by-products valorization of the cane sugar process. The CExC reports the exergy consumption of each stage of the process and the total consumption for each alternative which is important in resource consumption quantification, including renewability and hence process sustainability. Results show the advantage of combining both methods for the environmental assessment of cane sugar production. The application of this combination validates the results related with the category of resources and the contribution of the agricultural stage to the overall impact of the process. The environmental benefits of producing alcohol, biogas, animal food and fertilizers from the sugar production by-products were corroborated. The alternative IV has the lowest contribution to environmental impact in resource category and the minor value of the non-renewability index (6.59E-08). {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Ecological network analysis (ENA) is a systems-oriented methodology to analyze within system interactions used to identify holistic properties that are otherwise not evident from the direct observations. Like any analysis technique, the accuracy of the results is as good as the data available, but the additional challenge is that the data need to characterize an entire ecosystem's flows and storages. Thus, data requirements are substantial. As a result, there have, in fact, not been a significant number of network models constructed and development of the network analysis methodology has progressed largely within the purview of a few established models. In this paper, we outline the steps for one approach to construct network models. Lastly, we also provide a brief overview of the algorithmic methods used to construct food web typologies when empirical data are not available. It is our aim that such an effort aids other researchers to consider the construction of such models as well as encourages further refinement of this procedure. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Climatic measurements from almost 30 urban and suburban stations as well as specific measurements performed in 10 urban canyons in Athens. Greece, have been used to assess the impact of the urban climate on the energy consumption of buildings. It is found that for the city of Athens, where the mean heat island intensity exceeds 10??C, the cooling load of urban buildings may be doubled, the peak electricity load for cooling purposes may be tripled especially for higher set point temperatures, while the minimum COP value of air conditioners may be decreased up to 25{\%} because of the higher ambient temperatures. During the winter period, the heating load of centrally located urban buildings is found to be reduced up to 30{\%}. Regarding the potential of natural ventilation techniques when applied to buildings located in urban canyons, it is found that, mainly during the day, this is seriously reduced because of the important decrease of the wind speed inside the canyon. Air flow reduction may be up to 10 times the flow that corresponds to undisturbed ambient wind conditions. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The aggregate potential for urban mitigation of global climate change is insufficiently understood. Our analysis, using a dataset of 274 cities representing all city sizes and regions worldwide, demonstrates that economic activity, transport costs, geographic factors, and urban form explain 37{\%} of urban direct energy use and 88{\%} of urban transport energy use. If current trends in urban expansion continue, urban energy use will increase more than threefold, from 240 EJ in 2005 to 730 EJ in 2050. Our model shows that urban planning and transport policies can limit the future increase in urban energy use to 540 EJ in 2050 and contribute to mitigating climate change. However, effective policies for re- ducing urban greenhouse gas emissions differ with city type. The results show that, for affluent and mature cities, higher gasoline prices combined with compact urban form can result in savings in both residential and transport energy use. In contrast, for developing-country cities with emerging or nascent infra- structures, compact urban form, and transport planning can encourage higher population densities and subsequently avoid lock-in of high carbon emission patterns for travel. The results underscore a significant potential urbanization wedge for re- ducing energy use in rapidly urbanizing Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.},

abstract = {This paper describes the methodology and data used to determine greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions attributable to ten cities or city-regions: Los Angeles County, Denver City and County, Greater Toronto, New York City, Greater London, Geneva Canton, Greater Prague, Barcelona, Cape Town and Bangkok. Equations for determining emissions are developed for contributions from: electricity; heating and industrial fuels; ground transportation fuels; air and marine fuels; industrial processes; and waste. Gasoline consumption is estimated using three approaches: from local fuel sales; by scaling from regional fuel sales; and from counts of vehicle kilometres travelled. A simplified version of an intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) method for estimating the GHG emissions from landfill waste is applied. Three measures of overall emissions are suggested: (i) actual emissions within the boundary of the city; (ii) single process emissions (from a life-cycle perspective) associated with the city's metabolism; and (iii) life-cycle emissions associated with the city's metabolism. The results and analysis of the study will be published in a second paper. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The world's population is now over 50{\%} urban, and cities make an important contribution to national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Many cities are developing strategies to reduce their emissions. Here we ask how and why emissions differ between cities. Our study often global cities shows how a balance of geophysical factors (climate, access to resources, and gateway status) and technical factors (power generation, urban design, and waste processing) determine the GHGs attributable to cities. Within the overall trends, however, there are differences between cities with more or less public transit while personal income also impacts heating and industrial fuel use. By including upstream emissions from fuels, GHG emissions attributable to cities exceed those from direct end use by upto 25 Our findings should help foster intercity learning on reducing GHG emissions.},

abstract = {This study asks what is the 'best' way to measure urban energy efficiency. There has been recent interest in identifying efficient cities so that best practices can be shared, a process known as benchmarking. Previous studies have used relatively simple metrics that provide limited insight on the complexity of urban energy efficiency and arguably fail to provide a 'fair' measure of urban performance. Using a data set of 198 urban UK local administrative units, three methods are compared: ratio measures, regression residuals, and data envelopment analysis. The results show that each method has its own strengths and weaknesses regarding the ease of interpretation, ability to identify outliers and provide consistent rankings. Efficient areas are diverse but are notably found in low income areas of large conurbations such as London, whereas industrial areas are consistently ranked as inefficient. The results highlight the shortcomings of the underlying production-based energy accounts. Ideally urban energy efficiency benchmarks would be built on consumption-based accounts, but interim recommendations are made regarding the use of efficiency measures that improve upon current practice and facilitate wider conversations about what it means for a specific city to be energy-efficient within an interconnected economy. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The ecological footprint is a measure of the resources necessary to produce the goods that an individual or population consumes. It is also used as a measure of sustainability, though evidence suggests that it falls short. The assumptions behind footprint calculations have been extensively criticized; I present here further evidence that it fails to satisfy simple economic principles because the basic assumptions are contradicted by both theory and historical data. Specifically, I argue that the footprint arbitrarily assumes both zero greenhouse gas emissions, which may not be ex ante optimal, and national boundaries, which makes extrapolating from the average ecological footprint problematic. The footprint also cannot take into account intensive production, and so comparisons to biocapacity are erroneous. Using only the assumptions of the footprint then, one could argue that the Earth can sustain greatly increased production, though there are important limitations that the footprint cannot address, such as land degradation. Finally, the lack of correlation between land degradation and the ecological footprint obscures the effects of a larger sustainability problem. Better measures of sustainability would address these issues directly. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Water and energy are both important resources that are inextricably and reciprocally linked. Indeed, energy production requires a lot of water (e.g., cooling water at power plants), and numerous studies have investigated the water footprint of energy production (WFEP). However, energy is typically supplied to domestic consumers by both domestic and foreign producers, so it is necessary to take both internal and external energy productions into account. The aim of this study is to evaluate the water footprints of energy production and supply in Thailand by applying standard water footprint analysis methods based on bottom-up approaches, which define separate footprints based on production and consumption perspectives. Our findings show that the WFEP for 2010 was nine times greater than that for 1986, while the water footprint of energy supply (WFES) was eight times greater because of the use of biomass energy. We discuss external dependency, the impacts on domestic water resources, and policy implications, and we suggest ways to promote a reliable energy supply by limiting the use of water resources for energy production in Thailand.},

The current WFcons amounts to 6,139 l/cap/d (a volume of 2.93 km(3) annually), of which 52 l/cap/d (1{\%}) is attributed to domestic water, 448 l/cap/d (7{\%}) to the consumption of industrial products and 5,639 l/cap/d (92{\%}) to the consumption of agricultural products. The WFprod is 52 l/cap/d. Milan is thus a net virtual water importer, predominantly through the import of agricultural products. These are produced outside city borders, both in Italy and abroad. This shows the dependency of city dwellers on water resources from other river basins. In addition, the WFcons for a healthy diet (based on Mediterranean Food-Based Dietary Guidelines) and a vegetarian diet are analysed. The current Milanese diet consists of too much sugar, crop oils, meat, animal fats, milk and milk products and not enough cereals, rice, potatoes, vegetables and fruit. The latter two diets result in substantial WFcons reductions: -29{\%} (to 4,339 l/cap/d) for a healthy diet and -41{\%} (to 3,631 l/cap/d) for a vegetarian diet. Indeed, a lot of water could be saved by Milan citizens through a change in their diet. A sustainable city should account for its impacts beyond its borders.},

Organizations view many of these environmental programs, which may include technological and organizational development projects, as possible alternatives for gaining or maintaining a competitive advantage. One environmental program area that continues to gain in importance is one that focuses on the external relationships among organizations. To help evaluate alternatives that will effect this relationship we present a strategic decision framework that will aid managerial decision-making. This decision framework is based on literature and practice in the area of environmentally conscious business practices. The focus of this paper will be on the components and elements of green supply chain management and how they serve as a foundation for the decision framework.

Exergy analysis is applied to elucidate the resources flows from the natural environment into the society, between other countries or regions and the society, between the sectors of the society, and the emissions outflows into the natural environment from different sectors. For the China society broken down into seven sectors (i.e., extraction, conversion, agriculture, industry, transportation, tertiary and households) as one of the most complicated cases, systems account of environmental emissions as greenhouse gases and "three wastes" is carried out for the first time, combined with an updated resources account. The total societal exergy consumption amounts to 101.1 EJ, of which 93.6{\%} is due to resources use accounted as 94.6 EJ, of which 23.2{\%} is by the industry sector, 22.8{\%} by conversion, 20.4{\%} by households, 12.3{\%} by agriculture, 9.0{\%} by tertiary, 6.9{\%} by extraction and 5.4{\%} by transport, and 6.4{\%} due to environmental emissions accounted as 6481.6 PJ, including greenhouse gas emissions of 5706.1 PJ, with the highly remarkable fraction of 49.05{\%} from CH4 of the same importance as 50.91{\%} from CO2 and only 0.04{\%} from N2O, and "three wastes" emissions of only 775.5 PJ. The extraction sector is shown as the leading emitter with 32.6{\%} of the total emissions, followed by the industry with 20.0{\%}, agriculture with 17.3{\%}, and conversion sector with 16.8{\%}. To characterize the network performance in context of environmental resources from a systems ecological perspective, exergy-based ecological efficiency and resources conversion coefficient are found as 88.8{\%} and 91.3{\%} for the extraction sector, 29.0{\%} and 30.0{\%} for the conversion sector, 31.5{\%} and 33.5{\%} for the agriculture sector, 34.8{\%} and 36.1{\%} for the industry sector, 16.3{\%} and 17.3{\%} for the transportation sector, 38.4{\%} and 38.5{\%} for the tertiary sector, and only 1.3{\%} and 1.3{\%} for the households sector, respectively.

abstract = {This paper presented a thermodynamic synthesis that involved resource accounting, evaluation and modeling of urban ecosystems based on embodied cosmic exergy (EcE), which redefined embodied exergy with the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) as the reference for solar exergy. In a case study of the Beijing urban ecosystem, the major resources supporting the urban ecosystem, both from free natural resources and from the economy, were accounted for, analyzed and evaluated in the same units, Cosmic Joules (Jc). These indicators revealed the current performance of the Beijing urban ecosystem by considering five aspects of the system: EcE sources, EcE intensity, EcE welfare, environmental impacts and economic efficiency. Moreover, through the combination of the EcE synthesis with a systems dynamics, this research constructed an embodied cosmic exergy-based urban system model (EESM) using Beijing as an example of urban development. The results show that the 10 years from 2010 to 2020 will be very critical for the sustainable development of Beijing because many key factors, such as water resources, wastes and urban assets, might be confronted with great changes during this period. These changes will inevitably transform the urban system not only in its external circumstances but also in its inner structure and may lead to serious consequences. Of all the necessary resources, the most sensitive factor is water supply. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Patterson1998,
abstract = {Without a theory of value (price) in ecological economics, the valuation of ecosystem and economic resources cannot be rigorously defended. At the crux of the matter is the 'valuation' or 'mixed units' problem of commensurating biophysical inputs/outputs which are different. This paper critically reviews candidate theories of value which have emerged in the ecological economics literature for dealing with this problem. First of all, the Neo-Ricardian emerged, using Sraffa-type systems is discussed. In particular, Judson's assertion that the Sraffa system is suitable for ecological economics is questioned, as it is based on 'circular flow', generation of a 'surplus' and 'exchange values'. None of these ideas are consistent with a biophysical catheterisation of an economic system, which is paramount in ecological economics. A more fruitful avenue for establishing a biophysical theory of value based on ecological and thermodynamic principles, is to extend Patterson's quality equivalent methodology (QEM) to explicitly include mass flows in addition to energy. At this point a model close to Costanza and Hannon's biosphere model of price determination emerges. The extended QEM model however, has a number of important advantages over the Costanza-Hannon model because it has a more generalised formulation and is not reliant on necessarily using solar energy as the numeraire. The paper concludes with a discussion of some outstanding issues that need to be resolved before a biophysical theory of value can be properly established in ecological economics.},

The environmental impact of the waste water treatment plants was done by means of evaluating two environmental impact exergy based indexes: the environmental exergy efficiency ( env,exerg) and the total pollution rate (Rpol,t). The environmental exergy efficiency is defined as the ratio of the exergy of the useful effect of the WTP to the total exergy consumed by human and natural resources, including all the exergy inputs. That relation is an indication of the theoretical potential of future improvements of the process. Besides the environmental exergy efficiency, it is also used the total pollution rate, based on the definition done by Makarytchev (1997), as the ratio of the destroyed exergy associated to the process wastes to the exergy of the useful effect of the process. The analysis of the results shows that this method can be used to quantify and also optimise the environmental performance of Wastewater Treatment Plants.},

A comprehensive case study is conducted in Balcova geothermal district heating system (BGDHS) in Izmir, Turkey and actual thermal data are collected and employed for analysis. Using actual system data, an assessment of the district heating system performance, energy and exergy efficiencies, and exergy destructions in the system is conducted in this regard. The exergy destructions in the overall BGDHS are quantified and illustrated using exergy flow diagram. Furthermore, both energy and exergy flow diagrams are exhibited for comparison purposes. It is observed through analysis that the exergy destructions in the system particularly take place as the exergy of the fluid lost in the pumps, the heat exchanger losses, the exergy of the thermal water (geothermal fluid) reinjected and the natural direct discharge (hot water distribution losses) of the system, accounting for 1.64{\%}, 8.57{\%}, 14.84{\%} and 28.96{\%}, respectively, of the total exergy input to the BGDHS.

abstract = {Hydropower plays a major role in the Canadian electricity generation industry. Few attempts have been made, however, to assess the efficiency of hydropower generation in Canada. This paper analyzes the overall efficiency of hydropower generation in Canada from comprehensive viewpoints of electricity generating capability, its profitability, as well as environmental benefits and social responsibility using the TOPSIS (the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method. The factors that influence the efficiency of the hydropower generation are also presented to help to the sustainable hydropower production in Canada. The most important results of this study concern (1) the pivotal roles of energy saving and of the social responsibility in the overall efficiency of hydropower corporates and (2) the lower hydropower generation efficiency of some of the most important economic regions in Canada. Other results reveal that the overall efficiency of hydropower generation in Canada experienced an improvement in 2012, following a downtrend from 2005 to 2011. Amidst these influencing factors, energy saving and social responsibility are key factors in the overall efficiency scores while management (defined herein by the number of employees and hydropower stations of a corporation) has only a slightly negative impact on the overall efficiency score.},

Various devices are considered, ranging from simple electrical devices to generation systems for electrical power and for multiple products including electricity, and on to electrically driven. The insights provided by exergy are shown to be more useful than those provided by energy, which are sometimes misleading. Exergy is concluded to have a significant role in assessing and improving the efficiencies of electrical power technologies and systems, and provides a useful tool for engineers and scientists as well as decision and policy makers.},

abstract = {Exergy analysis (EA) has demonstrated to be useful in the assessment of the energy performance of technologies, including those regarding water management. In this paper, an EA-based index like the unit exergy cost (UEC) of different water-related technologies were obtained, from trans- port (pumping) to depuration and even brackish and seawater desalination. Those coefficients are important to quantify the additional energy consumption of present technologies with respect to the ideal ones, which correspond to the behaviour of a reversible process. Minimum UEC values were obtained in pumping techniques (1.5). Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) ranged from 4 to 5, and commercial desalination varied from 5 (reverse osmosis) to 21 (multi-stage flash distilla- tion). This affirms the fact that chemical-based water treatments are less efficient from the point of view of thermodynamics, however further improvements might be reached in those processes. Besides their embedded energy-efficiency information, the UEC values could be applied to assess water costs. For instance, the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) considers that envir- onmental costs (those to restore water bodies up to an objective state) have also to be charged to water users. Consequently, the UEC values of water technologies together with energy prices could easily be used to estimate those environmental costs associated to physico-chemical degra- dation of water bodies.},

Nevertheless there are also many environmental impacts; thus it is crucial that transportation planning is carried out in a sustainable manner meeting optimum travel needs, promote economic prosperity and environmental preservation. In assessing the efficiency of transportation, exergy analysis is an effective tool. This work presents an energy and exergy utilization assessment for the transportation sector of Greece taking into account the sectoral energy and exergy flows for the period over 1980-2003. Energy and exergy analyses are conducted for the four subsectors of the Greek transport sector, namely highways, railways, marine and civil aviation. The road subsector appears to be the most efficient in comparison to the other subsectors for the years between 1980 and 2003. It is believed that the exergy analysis presented here provides insights into the transport energy use and could assist in the planning of an efficient transport system. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The increasing prominence of Sustainable Development as a policy objective has initiated a debate on appropriate frameworks and tools that will both provide guidance for a shift towards sustainability as well as a measure, preferably quantitative, of that shift. Sustainability assessment has thus the challenging task of capturing, addressing and suggesting solutions for a diverse set of issues that affect stakeholders with different values and span over different spatial and temporal scales. However sustainability assessment is still not a mature framework in the sense that Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) are. This paper aims to provide suggestions for improving the sustainability evaluation part of a sustainability assessment. In particular it will provide a comprehensive review of different sustainability evaluation tools (from a reductionist perspective) as well as the feasibility of incorporating them within a sustainability assessment framework. Reviewed tools include monetary tools, biophysical models and sustainability indicators/composite indices that have been developed within different disciplines such as economics, statistics, ecology, engineering and town planning. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Waste is the symbol of inefficiency of any modern society and a representation of misallocated resources. Significant progress has been achieved in reducing waste but it varies from city to city. Currently, cities use their waste diversion rate as a tool to measure the performance of their waste management systems. However, diversion of waste from landfill does not give a holistic picture of zero waste performance. This paper conceptualises the concept of the 'zero waste city' and proposes a new tool to measure the performance of waste management systems called the 'zero waste index'. The zero waste index forecasts the amount of virgin materials, energy, water and greenhouse gas emissions substituted by the resources that are recovered from waste streams. Three high consuming cities (Adelaide, San Francisco and Stockholm) were analysed using the zero waste index. The zero waste indexes in Adelaide, San Francisco and Stockholm were found to be 0.23, 0.51 and 0.17 respectively (i.e. around 23{\%}, 51{\%} and 17{\%} of resources were recovered and potentially substituted for virgin materials). In addition, the zero waste index estimated the potential energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) and water savings due to resource recovery from municipal solid waste in each of the three cities. It is evident that the zero waste index is an innovative tool to assess waste management performance and materials substitution by waste management systems in different cities. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The non-linear, unexpected and severe responses of ecosystems to the environmental changes crossing ecological thresholds or environmental limits, necessitate the regular monitoring of the human-induced pressures to the urban ecosystems. The present study aims to introduce a spatial decision support system for sustainable environmental planning and management of urban ecosystems by establishing an Urban Carrying Capacity Load Number model (UCCLN) based on carrying capacity concepts and sustainability principles.This model, by applying 30 temporal and spatial indicators continuously monitors the environmental loads on the urban ecosystems. Environmental load was represented by load number index. It was calculated in each zone of study area (urban districts). Geographical Information System (GIS) was used to establish UCCLN model and Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS). The study area was Tehran metropolis, the capital of Iran. The results showed that none of the 115 urban districts of Tehran had optimal Total Load Number (TLN) ranging from (10 to100); 7 districts (6{\%}) had low-to-medium range of TLN (TLN = 100-200); 11 districts (9.5{\%}) had medium-to-high range (TLN = 200-300); 57 districts (49.5{\%}) had high-to-very high range (TLN = 300-400); 40 districts (34.7{\%}) had the TLN range of very high-to-critical (TLN = 400-500); and none of them had the TLN of 500. Furthermore, the results revealed that Tehran has already overshot its ecological thresholds. Not only most of the 30 indicators of environmental pressure in most of the districts (85{\%}) had high DCC and LN scores, but also most of the 115 districts obtained high DCC, and as a result LN scores. The need for developing more efficient urban planning and management strategies to cope with the increasing environmental loads in the study area is inevitable. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The industrial revolution and the exploitation of fossil fuels fostered profound changes on transportation systems and infrastructure enabling unprecedented urban growth. Urban regions, which now host the majority of the world's population, resemble a linear metabolism: importing most of their raw materials, food, and energy, and using these resources in an inefficient manner resulting in waste outflows. Regarding energy flows, cities are highly depending on fossil fuels and the rate at which fossil fuels are consumed is faster than their generation rate. Therefore, a shift is needed toward more sustainable energy sources. We propose a sustainable urban energy planning approach, based on the thermodynamic principle, exergy. This approach integrates multi-functionality, interaction between urban functions, and harvesting of local renewable and residual resources - Urban Harvest Approach. Synergies between urban functions are crucial to reach productive and sustainable urban regions. Resource exchange among different urban functions offers possibilities toward productive urban regions aiming for closed cycle resources management, e.g. integrating industrial ecosystems in urban ecosystems. Our method consists of six steps: (i) land-use inventory; (ii) energy demand inventory; (iii) local renewable/residual energy potential analysis; (iv) clusters of spatial functions exploration; (v) energetic linkages analysis; (vi) network patterns exploration. We tested the method at neighborhood scale, Kerkrade-West, The Netherlands. Results showed that linking spatial clusters is crucial toward circular urban metabolism. Spatial design should promote mixed land-use. The case showed that spatial planning based on urban energy harvesting is a useful method to translate generic goals to local spatial interventions. Urban energy harvesting can contribute to increased productivity, resulting in increased sustainability of urban areas, e.g. social, environmental benefits. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Hammarby Sj{\"{o}}stad is a district in Stockholm, Sweden, designed with high environmental ambitions. These ambitions were later expressed in the Hammarby Model, an integrated infrastructural system aiming to minimize the metabolic flows of the district by closing its material and energy flows. Various integrated systems were already present in Stockholm when discussions began around the development of the Hammarby Model. Using a conceptual framework inspired by transition theory, this paper analyses the process of designing and building the Hammarby Model. Our aim is to create a better understanding of the implications of systems integration at the urban district level. The findings of the study show that systems integration may both enable and constrain further innovation. On one hand, integration facilitates the implementation of technologies that are add-ons or that solve a reverse salient experienced by the integrated system. On the other hand, technologies that are perceived to threaten the integrated system are locked out, prohibiting further optimization of the system. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Methods and indicators are needed to assess the urban ecosystem health status, amongst which energy and material metabolism should be integrated to enhance understanding of ecological patterns and processes of urban ecosystems. Therefore, emergy synthesis combining energetics with systems ecology is applied to assess systematically the health status of urban ecosystems. Combining ecosystem health levels with spatial geographical information of different land use subsystems, the spatial distribution of urban ecosystem health is obtained, which is helpful for urban ecological regulation and spatial optimization. Taking the situation of Guangzhou, China in 2005 as a case study, the relative health states based on emergy indicators and set pair analysis is evaluated. Results show that the health levels of the cultivated land, as well as areas with middle and low density buildings are relatively positive, while that of high density building and traffic areas are relatively weak. Through analysis of different land use subsystems, required factors of a healthy ecosystem are summarized, including moderate economic productivity but without much exploitation and disturbance, reasonable structure of energy and resources usage, medium resilience under pressure, moderate ecosystem service provisioning, and small environmental impact on surroundings. The spatial distribution of urban ecosystem health states is also obtained, such that the northern part of Guangzhou is defined as the conservation area, the middle and southern parts are defined as the maintenance area, while the south central and south western parts are defined as the key regulation area where a suitable scheme should be implemented to control the population density and resolve the concomitant problems. Moreover, the impact power of different indicators on the final health status is classified into five levels when combining the indicator weights with the main assessment factors of urban ecosystem health, which is useful for defining the regulation priority amongst a few indicators. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The urbanisation process has exceeded the traditional pace of human settlement and is moving towards the formation of large urban regions in response to an increasing demand for services and environmental goods, combined with increasing production of waste and emissions. Therefore, it is fundamental to determine resource flows into cities, especially in developing countries, as well as the transformations that occur and the outputs that are produced, such as products, services and wastes. In this study, we apply urban material flow analysis, which determines the flows of inputs (water, energy, food and others) and outputs (wastewater, air pollution, wastes and others) to the city of Bogot{\'{a}}, Colombia to determine the relationship between demand for resources and the environmental impact of outputs. Quantitative and qualitative data for Bogot{\'{a}} are used to assess and compare the material and energy flow trends for this city. The results indicate that in this city, inputs and outputs are directly and linearly related. Consumption of energy and construction materials has increased, whereas food and water consumption have remained steady. Levels of recycling and sewage treatment are low, and emissions such as particulate matter have decreased. The findings from this study can be used to formulate and apply policies and strategies to improve the sustainability of resources, decrease the reliance on physical resources, increase the efficiency of resource and energy use in urban areas, and enhance sustainable production and consumption in cities. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The waste crisis in Campania has inspired a vast amount of studies. Nevertheless, very little research has been done to explain the figures of waste generation and disposal in the region. The analyses carried out so far according to the indicators used by official statistics-i.e. Waste Generated, Waste Generated per capita and Separate Collection-fail to represent this hot spot case. This paper attempts to bridge this gap. Adopting the rationale of a new accounting system, the Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM), two waste indicators are proposed to complement the conventional ones: the Metabolic Rate of Waste and the Density of Waste. Then a multi-scale analysis of the Density of Waste Disposed (DWD) tests its suitability to characterise Campania's waste patterns. The data cover the period from 1999 to 2007. The results show that the DWD complements available indicators and further helps to explain the biophysical pressure and ecological unsustainability of the waste management in the region. The multi-scale analysis shows that regional data hide a relevant territorial diversity, emergent in the provincial analysis and even more so in the municipal one. These results have implications for governance and for the debate about mono-scale versus multi-scale solutions to waste management problems. Finally, the analysis allows some analytical generalisations on the suitability of the DWD to detect situations of potential waste crisis in other study-contexts. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cities are complex systems of accumulated matter. The continuous process of matter accumulation in urban systems differs in intensity across the globe according to specific urban features, such as location and age of the urban tissue, and as a physical manifestation of metabolic lineaments, material accumulation should differ amongst cities. In this paper, a new indicator to measure this process of material accumulation is proposed, namely, the Technomass. Emulating ecology, which measures biomass in natural ecosystems, a sample of different urban tissues in a given city - Bogot?? - was measured in terms of volume and rates of matter accumulation. Technomass is able to indicate overall asymptotic behaviour, specific spatial profiles and intensification of rates in time. In metabolic terms, the indicator looks into the black box, providing the possibility to link metabolic behaviours with urban form and attempting to fill the gap between urban planning, urban metabolism (UM) and Material Flow Analysis (MFA). This new indicator offers a broad scope of applications. Further possibilities and links to urban research and policy making are explored in the discussion section. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In addition, it addresses the role of utilities in the provision of services and regulatory actions that, along with public governance, may influence (and/or control) the urban metabolism. In the article, we give background context to the growth and development of megacities, their overarching socio-economic issues, and the definition of their boundaries. Two methodologies to define megacity boundaries are compared, showing that the definition of 'megacity' is not trivial and that further investigation is needed to establish a baseline for comparison of urban metabolism data. Use of the standardized indicator set will ease inter-city comparisons of urban metabolism, whilst enhancing knowledge of megacities and their transformation into sustainable systems.},

abstract = {Analysis of the structure and function of urban metabolic systems is an important goal of urban research. We used network pathways and network utility analysis to analyze the basic network structure of the urban metabolic system and the complex ecological relationships within the system, providing a new way to perform such research. Using four Chinese cities as examples, we developed an ecological network model of the urban metabolic system. By using network pathway analysis, we studied the changing relationships between metabolic length and the number of metabolic pathways, and between metabolic length and reachability. Based on the distribution of the number of metabolic pathways, we describe the basic structure and intercompartment relationships of the system. By using the sign distribution in the network utility matrix, we determined the ecological relationships and degree of mutualism between the compartments of the system. The basic components of the system consisted of the internal environment, the external environment, and the agricultural, industrial, and domestic sectors. With increasing metabolic length, the ecological relationships among the components of the system became more diverse, and the numbers of metabolic paths and their reachability improved. Although the basic network structure of the four cities was identical, the mutualism index differed. Beijing's mutualism index was superior to that of Shanghai, and much higher than those of Tianjin and Chongqing. By analyzing the structure and function of the urban metabolic system, we provide suggestions for optimizing the structure and adjusting the relationships, and propose methods for the application of ecological network analysis in future urban system research.

@article{Jorgensen1995,
abstract = {Hitherto, applied calculations of exergy for higher organisms have been based on traditional thermodynamic considerations, which did not take into account the organizational level of organisms. It seems reasonable to include such perspectives in a thermodynamic evaluation of ecosystems. Therefore, two methods that are theoretically more sound for calculations of exergy for higher organisms are proposed in this paper. The first is based upon the thermodynamic information due to genes. The method is rooted in statistical thermodynamics and should be considered the best candidate for exergy calculations of ecosystems including higher organisms. The second method is a parallel to the method used for calculation of emergy, and is based on the cost of free energy computed from an ecological network. Because this method does not consider the increase of information due to evolution, it should be considered theoretically less sound than the first mentioned method. It is, however, interesting to compare the two methods, as they to a certain extent reflect the differences between emergy and exergy. Emergy attempts, as exergy, to account for the quality of energy by the use of a transformity factor. The transformity factors for calculation of emergy are found from the network as the number of solar equivalents that it has cost to construct the considered organism. Emergy is therefore often more easy to compute, provided that the ecological network is known, while exergy after the new methods for calculations presented here seems to have a better theoretical basis. The two methods tested for calculation of exergy give different results, but the results are in the same order of magnitude. The two major problems in development of ecological models are the parameter estimation and the selection of the best model structure. The latter requires that more ecological system properties are incorporated in our models. A procedure based upon recent developments in ecosystem theory is proposed to meet this requirement. It should be considered a first approach to a theoretical improvement of the modelling procedure for development of models with more ecological properties. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {The principle that energy does not cycle in ecosystems is examined by path and flow analyses of a small, steady state, energy model of an oyster reef community. Path numbers increase combinatorially without bound as path length increases, at much faster rates with energy storage than without. Energy flows over only very short paths in the nonstorage case, but with storage present most flow is associated with long paths. Cycling results. A cycling index modified from the literature standard to include storage shows 11{\%} cycling in the subject model. Energy does cycle in ecosystems; it differs from matter in its dissipation, not cycling, characteristics. A new result is the role of storage in diversifying path structure and increasing flows in networks. The basis for this is examined through influence theory of mathematical graphs, with the conclusion that energy storage as biomass is the root cause of ecosystem energy cycling. Issues of food chain length and embodied energy are reviewed in light of the long paths and related energy flows present in even small order models. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

It shapes many of the interactions between human civilisation and the natural environment. However, in the UK and other advanced economies, NI faces serious challenges of: • Growing demand for infrastructure services from a modern economy and growing and ageing population; • Significant investment requirements so that an ageing infrastructure system can meet this demand and provide reliable, cost-effective and high quality services; • Increasing complexity and interdependence of infrastructure networks. A growing stock of infrastructure helps to promote economic growth by increasing productivity, participation in the economy and aggregate demand. Infrastructure investment is also necessary to reduce the likelihood and consequences of system failure and to ensure a healthy environment and a stable climate. The lead-time and long lifetime of major infrastructure means that a long term view is essential. Yet a long term strategic approach is challenged by the associated uncertainties, be they technical, environmental, political or financial. Interdependence between infrastructure sectors add to the complexity and uncertainty in the strategic planning of NI.},

However, a review of current practice suggests that priority is often given to the measurability and policy relevance of these metrics. Their analytical validity - i.e. their ability to act as meaningful representations of the urban system and thus inform appropriate policy responses - is less certain. An examination of London's USIs confirms this gap between theory and practice and identifies vague definitions of urban sustainability as part of the problem. A ?service niche? approach to indicator selection is therefore outlined, using pervasive goal-oriented urban services such as energy or water systems to guide the selection of policy-relevant interconnected metrics. Strategies for expanding such niches to wider assessments of urban sustainability are also discussed. Copyright 2007 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

@article{Sciubba2005,
abstract = {The paper discusses the similarities and the incompatibilities between two forms of Energy Analysis (exergy and emergy, 'EXA' and 'EMA' in the following), both of which try to represent the behavior of physical systems by means of cumulative energy input/output methods that result in a double integration over space and time domains. Theoretical background, definitions and balance algebra are discussed first, in a 'statement-counterstatement' format that helps pinpointing differences and similarities. A significant, albeit simplified, benchmark case (ethanol production from corn) is used to compare the results and analytically assess the merits of each approach as well as possible synergic aspects. Corn production, transport and industrial conversion to ethanol are included in the analysis. First, mass balance and energy accounting are performed in each step of the process, then, exergy and emergy evaluations are carried out separately to lead to a set of performance indicators, the meaning of which is discussed with reference to their proper scale of application. The Authors underline that each method has its own preferred field of application and conclude that the two approaches appear to be characterized not much as different (and therefore competing) tools, but as different paradigms, whose meta-levels (their 'philosophies') substantially differ. In particular, EXA is found to provide the most correct and insightful assessment of thermodynamic features of any process and to offer a clear quantitative indication of both the irreversibilities and the degree of matching between the used resources and the end-use material or energy flows. EXA combined with costing considerations results in Thermo-Economics (TE), presently the best engineering method for System optimization. One of EXA recent extensions, Extended Exergy Accounting (EEA) includes all externalities in the exergy resource accounting, thus providing a more complete picture of how a process is interacting with its socio-economical environment and with the Biosphere. EMA further expands the evaluation to the larger scale of the Biosphere and properly accounts for the globality of the energy and resource flows supporting complex living systems. Although some conceptual assumptions and methodological differences appear irreconcilable, important similarities are also found that may lead to further methodological and practical convergences. Note: Although a significant confrontation and debate accompanied the development of this paper, contrasting opinions about important features of the two approaches still exist. Therefore, SU takes full responsibility of statements in Sections 2, 4.1, 6.2, 7.1 while ES takes full responsibility of statements in Sections 3, 4.2, 6.1, 7.2.

We introduce two generalized models of resource use that incorporate a choice between virgin resource extraction and post-consumption resource recycling. These models are used as a basis for expressing Dp as a function of non-dimensional indicators for three resource conservation strategies: exergy cycling fraction ($\psi$) for resource recycling, exergy efficiency ($\phi$) for process efficiency gains, and renewed exergy fraction ($\Omega$) for extent of renewed resource use. We use the resulting expressions to fully characterize strategy interaction, strategy limitations, and the roles that these strategies play in allowing resource consumption to occur with decreasing levels of resource depletion.

In this two part series, we will use a thermodynamic interpretation of ecosystem evolution to strengthen this biological-industrial (B-I) ecosystem analogy. We begin by describing limitations in the current analogy and discussing resulting implications for the development and implementation of IE principles. We propose that these limitations arise largely from a poor definition of resource consumption. We then show that defining resource consumption as a process of removing exergy from a resource provides a basis for interpreting ecosystem evolution as a process of allowing consumption to occur with decreasing levels of depletion, i.e., a process of [`]de-linking' consumption and depletion. We use thermodynamic principles to deduce the limitations and interrelation of several strategies for de-linking consumption and depletion. Lastly, we explore the benefits and limitations of using the proposed interpretation of ecosystem evolution as an analogy for the development of industrial systems.},

abstract = {Nation-level Ecological Footprint accounts are currently produced for more than 150 nations, with multiple calculations available for some nations. The data sets that result from these national assessments typically serve as the basis for Footprint calculations at smaller scales, including those for regions, cities, businesses, and individuals. Global Footprint Network's National Footprint Accounts, supported and used by more than 70 major organizations worldwide, contain the most widely used national accounting methodology today. The National Footprint Accounts calculations are undergoing continuous improvement as better data becomes available and new methodologies are developed. In this paper, a community of active Ecological Footprint practitioners and users propose key research priorities for improving national Ecological Footprint accounting. For each of the proposed improvements, we briefly review relevant literature, summarize the current state of debate, and suggest approaches for further development. The research agenda will serve as a reference for a large scale, international research program devoted to furthering the development of national Ecological Footprint accounting methodology. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Human development is measured by four indictors including gross national income per capita, life expectancy, mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling. In addition, the resources are measured by three indicators including carbon dioxide emission per capita, electric power consumption per capita and energy use per capita. The findings reveal that Croatia, Hong Kong, Hungary, Israel, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland can utilize the minimum resources to achieve their current human development level, give them the highest opportunity to achieve the sustainable human development among high income countries. Among upper middle income countries, Angola, Colombia, Gabon, Panama and Peru have the highest opportunity to achieve the sustainable human development due to their 100 percent efficiency in utilizing their resources. Finally, Albania, Cameroon, Congo, Ghana, Nigeria, Philippines, Senegal, Sri Lanka and Zambia are more likely to achieve the sustainable human development than any other lower middle income countries.},

abstract = {An evaluation of interlinkages and synergies among the different resources and performance patterns in the city of Rome (Italy) was accomplished by means of decomposition equations, in order to identify the major drivers of change in the investigated period as well as future low-resource scenarios. A half-a-century historical series (1962-2008) of energy and resource consumption in the city of Rome (Italy) was investigated in order to ascertain the links between resource use and complexity change. Environmental, material and energy inputs were firstly evaluated as actual energy and mass flows, then converted to emergy units to provide an assessment on a common ground. Results show that the sustainability of the urban system decreased steadily in the investigated period, as confirmed by both intensive and extensive parameters. The demand for abiotic matter, water, energy and emergy (environmental work) was accounted for over time and referred to the population (per-capita indicators) and current prices economic product generated by the city (GVA, Gross Value Added). Moreover, the effects associated with the emissions were evaluated, with a special focus on global warming and acidification potential. The changes in the urban metabolism occurred within the investigated period were analyzed considering the variation of different inputs necessary to drive the city (electricity, fuels, goods, machineries, etc.). Finally, a decomposition analysis was performed to identify the main causes and drivers associated with the changes in the city metabolism. Decomposition results show that the increased fraction of imports compared to local sources, of non-renewable resources compared to renewables, as well as of population and per capita income not accompanied by sufficient increase of energy and material efficiency are the major drivers of such unsustainability pattern and call for policies that focus on optimization of production and consumption patterns in times of unavoidable shrinking of resource basis.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to the evaluation of energy conversion processes and systems, based on an extended representation of their exergy flow diagram. This approach is a systematic attempt to integrate into a unified coherent formalism both Cumulative Exergy Consumption and Thermo-economic methods, and constitutes a generalisation of both, in that its framework allows for a direct quantitative comparison of non-energetic quantities like labour and environmental impact (hence the apposition ‘Extended'). A critical examination of the existing state-of-the-art of energy- and exergy analysis methods and paradigms indicates that an extension of the existing ‘Design and Optimisation' procedures to include explicitly ‘non-energetic externalities' is indeed feasible. It appears that it can indeed be successfully argued that some of the issues that are difficult to address with a purely monetary theory of value can be resolved by Extended Exergy Accounting (‘EEA' in the following) methods without introducing arbitrary assumptions external to the theory. In this respect, EEA can be regarded as a natural development of the economic theory of production of commodities, which it extends by properly accounting for the unavoidable energy dissipation in the productive chain. While a systematic description of the EEA theory is discussed in previous work by the same author, the present paper aims at a more specific target, and presents a formal representation of the application of EEA to a cogenerating plant based on a gas turbine process. It is shown that the solution indeed leads to an ‘optimal' design, and that its formalism embeds even extended Thermo-economic formulations.},

abstract = {Sustainability is rapidly moving from an abstract concept to a measurable state of dynamic human-ecological systems. The large number of economic, social, and environmental indicators currently available provides an unwieldy view of system sustainability. To aid policy decisions, these indicators are therefore either presented in the context of a conceptual framework, or quantitatively aggregated into indices. Due to the quantitative nature of sustainability indices, their results may be given more weight by scientists and policy-makers. However, policy decisions can be ineffective or even counterproductive if they do not consider factors which influence index behavior: the scale of the available data and choice of system boundaries; the inclusion, transformation, and weighting of indicator data; and the aggregation method used. As previous reviews have demonstrated, sustainability indices do not rank countries consistently, even when using some of the same indicator data. Several improvements would increase the utility of sustainability indices for policy decisions, particularly the identification of biases introduced by the index methodology and data inclusion. The discrepancy of current sustainability indices due to theoretical or methodological differences supports the use of several complementary indices. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the discourse about sustainable development, 'constant natural capital' is frequently referred to as a criterion for ecological sustainability. But what is 'natural capital'? The concept will be analyzed by presenting arguments in favour of using the term and different versions of sustainability (strong and weak). Subsequently, a critique of the 'natural capital' concept is brought forward, from an ecological as well as from an economic perspective. Following this critique, the use of material inputs and the material input per unit of service (MIPS) as a measure for the environmental impact potential is suggested. Dematerialisation is understood to be an alternative management rule for sustainability. In conclusion, a change of perspective is proposed. Due to the conceptual and measurement problems associated with the 'constant-natural-capital' criterion (which refers to a stock), it seems more reasonable from a scientific as well as from a practical perspective to add flows (i.e. material inputs) to a decision criterion for whether a development is sustainable or not.},

Based on the account of the extended exergy utilization in the sector of urban socio-economic system, which is considered as the composition of extraction (Ex), conversion (Co), agriculture (Ag), industry (In), transportation (Tr), tertiary (Te) and households (Do) sectors, an urban ecological network model is constructed to gain insights into the economic processes oriented to sustainable urban development. Taking Beijing city as the case, the network accounting and related ecological evaluation of a practical urban economy are carried out in this study in the light of flux, efficiency, utility and structure analysis. The results showed that a large quantity of energy and resources have to be consumed to maintain the structure and function of a city. The thermodynamic efficiencies of individual sector in Beijing remain at a low level. The social system in Beijing is a highly competitive network, and there are 8 competitive relations and only two mutualistic ones. The Domestic and Agricultural sector are the major controlling factors of the system. Moreover, the assessment results of Beijing are compared with the other three socio-economic systems, Norway, UK and Italy, and the ecological network function and structure comparisons are correspondingly illuminated and discussed. The conclusions indicate that the exergy-based network analysis can be refined to become an integrative tool for evaluation, policy-making and regulation for urban socio-economic system management concerning structure and efficiency at urban levels. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The keys of studying urban sustainable development are material metabolism flux and efficiency. Metabolism flux of urban materials can only reflect the metabolism velocity, while its eco-efficiency can determine the metabolism capacity to support socio-economic development. The general model and the measure model of the eco-efficiency were set up, based on the source recycle (decreasing the consumption of crude resources) and the terminal recycle (decreasing the discharge of pollutants) of production and life. These models were employed to study material metabolism flux and efficiency in Shenzhen, China. Results showed that water, energy and waste metabolism fluxes have increased since 1998 with constant socio-economic development, and their eco-efficiencies have also increased rapidly. When GDP rose by 2.7 times, the metabolism fluxes of urban water and electricity rose by 1.5 and 3.0 times, respectively. When the added value of industry rose by 3.7 times, the metabolism fluxes of industrial water, electricity, energy and waste rose by 1.9, 3.5, 2.7 and 2.0 times, respectively. When population rose by 1.5 times, the metabolism fluxes of residential water and electricity rose by 1.8 and 1.7 times, respectively. During the period, the resource efficiency, environmental efficiency and eco-efficiency rose by 1.8, 3.7 and 2.3 times, respectively. Whereas the efficiency of material metabolism has been improved in Shenzhen, the scarcity of material resources has become more and more serious. Therefore, it is necessary to further improve the efficiency of material metabolism. The keys of improving the eco-efficiency of urban material metabolism are the increasing of resource and environmental efficiencies, and the establishing of the recycling chain of re-utilization of waste resources. ?? 2007 Ecological Society of China.},

A life cycle approach is taken, where the production, use, and end-of-life stages of these rainwater harvesting systems are quantified in terms of energy and material requirements in order to produce 1 m3 of rainwater per year for laundry purposes. The results show that the highest exergy input is associated with the energy uses, namely the transport of the materials to construct the rainwater harvesting systems. The scenario with the highest exergetic efficiency considers a 24 household building with a 21 m3 rainwater storage tank installed below roof.

abstract = {The natural water system maintains its dynamic equilibrium through a hydrological cycle that involves a series of natural processes. Such a natural water cycle has been much disturbed by human activities in the process of water use. An urban water system was thus modeled in this paper as a series of artificial water cycles overlaid upon the natural water cycle. The system was thermodynamically analyzed by calculating the entropy budget as $\Delta$S = $\Delta$iS + $\Delta$eS where $\Delta$iS and $\Delta$eS are the entropy increases due to natural and artificial contributions, respectively. The natural water cycle free from human disturbance should possess the nature of self maintenance of water and materials balance and could be assumed as a pseudo-reversible process with $\Delta$iS → 0. $\Delta$eS was then supposed as to be contributed by artificial disturbances on water quantity such as by water withdrawal, and on water quality such as by pollutant discharge. A series of models were developed for calculating $\Delta$eS. As a result of scenario analysis of urban water system in Xi'an, a metropolitan in northwestern China, using these models, it was indicated that under the current condition of water supply and wastewater treatment, if 20{\%} of the treated wastewater could be reused, $\Delta$eS would be decreased by 15.22{\%} from the current level, while if the percent of treated wastewater reuse could be increased to 40{\%}, $\Delta$eS would be decreased by 29.93{\%}. Thermodynamic analysis thus provided a tool for quantitative evaluation of the effect of urban wastewater reclamation and reuse. {\textcopyright} 2011 Desalination Publications.

The measures chosen are green national net product, Genuine Savings, ecological footprint, Indicator of Sustainable Economic Welfare, Genuine Progress Indicator, Pollution-sensitive Human Development Indicator, Sustainable Human Development Indicator and French Dashboard on Sustainable Development. A theoretical description of each index highlights their advantages and drawbacks, underlining the fact that no indicator is perfect and no one can give an exhaustive view of sustainable development. Therefore, the analysis of various indicators is necessary to evaluate sustainable development with accuracy. Empirical results of measures of well-being show that French development was improving between 1990 and 2000. Concerning sustainability, indicators support different conclusions. It seems that French development was weakly sustainable but unsustainable in the strong sense over the period examined. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Of late, religion seems to be everywhere, suffusing U.S. politics and popular culture and acting as both a unifying and a divisive force. This collection of manifestos, Supreme Court decisions, congressional testimonies, speeches, articles, book excerpts, pastoral letters, interviews, song lyrics, memoirs, and poems reflects the vitality, diversity, and changing nature of religious belief and practice in American public and private life over the last half century. Encompassing a range of perspectives, this book illustrates the ways in which individuals from all along the religious and political spectrum have engaged religion and viewed it as a crucial aspect of society. The anthology begins with documents that reflect the close relationship of religion, especially mainline Protestantism, to essential ideas undergirding Cold War America. Covering both the center and the margins of American religious life, this volume devotes extended attention to how issues of politics, race, gender, and sexuality have influenced the religious mainstream. A series of documents reflects the role of religion and theology in the civil rights, feminist, and gay rights movements as well as in conservative responses. Issues regarding religion and contemporary American culture are explored in documents about the rise of the evangelical movement and the religious right; the impact of "new" (post-1965) immigrant communities on the religious landscape; the popularity of alternative, New Age, and non-Western beliefs; and the relationship between religion and popular culture.The editors conclude with selections exploring major themes of American religious life at the millennium, including both conservative and New Age millennialism, as well as excerpts that speculate on the future of religion in the United States. The documents are grouped by theme into nine chapters and arranged chronologically therein. Each chapter features an extensive introduction providing context for and analysis of the critical issues raised by the primary sources.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to discuss conceptual requirements for a City Sustainability Index (CSI) and to review existing major sustainability indices/indicators in terms of the requirements. The following indices are reviewed: Ecological Footprint (EF), Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI), Dashboard of Sustainability (DS), Welfare Index, Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare, City Development Index, emergy/exergy, Human Development Index (HDI), Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI), Environmental Policy Index (EPI), Living Planet Index (LPI), Environmentally-adjusted Domestic Product (EDP), Genuine Saving (GS), and some applications of composite indices or/and multivariate indicators to local or regional context as case studies. The key conceptual requirements for an adequate CSI are: (i) to consider environmental, economic and social aspects (the triple bottom line of sustainability) from the viewpoint of strong sustainability; (ii) to capture external impacts (leakage effects) of city on other areas beyond the city boundaries particularly in terms of environmental aspects; (iii) to create indices/indicators originally for the purpose of assessing city sustainability; and (iv) to be able to assess world cities in both developed and developing countries using common axes of evaluation. Based on the review, we conclude that it is necessary to create a new CSI that enables us to assess and compare cities' sustainability performance in order to understand the global impact of cities on the environment and human life as compared with their economic contribution. In the future, the CSI will be able to provide local authorities with guidance toward sustainable paths. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@book{Rosen1991,
abstract = {Why are living things alive? As a theoretical biologist, Robert Rosen saw this as the most fundamental of all questions-and yet it had never been answered satisfactorily by science. The answers to this question would allow humanity to make an enormous leap forward in our understanding of the principles at work in our world. For centuries, it was believed that the only scientific approach to the question "What is life?" must proceed from the Cartesian metaphor (organism as machine). Classical approaches in science, which also borrow heavily from Newtonian mechanics, are based on a process called "reductionism." The thinking was that we can better learn about an intricate, complicated system (like an organism) if we take it apart, study the components, and then reconstruct the system-thereby gaining an understanding of the whole. However, Rosen argues that reductionism does not work in biology and ignores the complexity of organisms. Life Itself, a landmark work, represents the scientific and intellectual journey that led Rosen to question reductionism and develop new scientific approaches to understanding the nature of life. Ultimately, Rosen proposes an answer to the original question about the causal basis of life in organisms. He asserts that renouncing the mechanistic and reductionistic paradigm does not mean abandoning science. Instead, Rosen offers an alternate paradigm for science that takes into account the relational impacts of organization in natural systems and is based on organized matter rather than on particulate matter alone. Central to Rosen's work is the idea of a "complex system," defined as any system that cannot be fully understood by reducing it to its parts. In this sense, complexity refers to the causal impact of organization on the system as a whole. Since both the atom and the organism can be seen to fit that description, Rosen asserts that complex organization is a general feature not just of the biosphere on Earth-but of the universe itself.},

abstract = {Contaminants cause a decrease in the quality of materials with each recycling step. These quality losses should be minimized to increase the sustainability of resources use. Quality losses cannot be measured using weight-based recovery definitions alone, as the quality degradation cannot be translated by mass measures. Therefore, a better measure of the efficiency of resource use is investigated in the present work. Exergy is a measure of the quality of the energy and of resources in systems. The exergy losses are a thermodynamic measure of exhaustion and thus, of the quality losses in the resource systems. We describe a method to calculate the exergy content and exergy losses of metals during recovery and recycling of a concept car. The exergy losses attributed to recycling (the pollution with other metals) and the consequent need for dilution can be used as indicators of the quality loss of materials and of the efficiency of resource use in product systems. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on ecological thermodynamics, an indicator system is established in this paper to evaluate the fluxes, stocks, and effiency of the urban material metabolism using emergy analysis. Also, a new model for the urban material metabolism is proposed to define the production possibility curve using a wealth index (WI) and an ecological effiency index (EEI). Then, six large Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen are selected as typical cases to validate the proposed model. The results show that Shenzhen has the highest metabolic capacity, followed by Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Chongqing. It is also reflected that different urban material metabolisms of the six cities are resulted from the varied regional metabolic capacities, thus providing insights into how cities improve their metabolic capacities. Meanwhile, Shenzhen has the highest WI and EEI, Chongqing has the lowest WI and EEI, and Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou has low WI and high EEI. It is also shown that the sustainable operation of the urban material metabolism reflects the mutualism and symbiosis between socioeconomic development and ecological environment protection. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Cities ("urban superorganisms") exhibit metabolic processes. Disturbance of these processes results from the high throughput of the socioeconomic system as a result of the flow of resources between it and its surroundings. Based on systematic ecology and emergy synthesis, we developed an emergy-based indicator system for evaluating urban metabolic factors (flux, structures, intensity, efficiency, and density), and evaluated the status of Beijing's environment and economic development by diagramming, accounting for, and analyzing the material, energy, and monetary flows within Beijing's metabolic system using biophysically based ecological accounting. We also compared the results with those of four other Chinese cities (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Ningbo, and Baotou) and China as a whole to assess Beijing's development status. From 1990 to 2004, Beijing's metabolic flux, metabolic intensity, and metabolic density increased significantly. The city's metabolic processes depend excessively on nonrenewable resources, but the pressure on resources from outside of the city decreased continuously. The metabolic efficiency increased by around 12{\%} annually throughout the study period. Beijing had a highest metabolic fluxes and density compared with the four other cities; its metabolic efficiency was lower, and its metabolic intensity was higher. Evaluating these metabolic indicators revealed weaknesses in the urban metabolic system, thereby helping planners to identify measures capable of sustaining these urban metabolic processes.

abstract = {Recycling contributes significantly to the natural resources preservation. However since recycling technology at the same time requires primary materials and energy input, both contributing to the natural resources depletion, it is important to evaluate the resource efficiency of the whole recycling chain to determine the actual benefit of recycling. For such an evaluation exergy analysis can be used by calculation of the exergy efficiency as an indicator for the resource efficiency of the recycling chain. In this paper exergy analysis is added as a metric to the fundamental recycling system optimisation model developed previously by the authors. This addition allows evaluation and optimisation of the recycling system environmental performance on a fundamental basis, capturing exergy efficiency in the system as a function of physical, metallurgical and thermal processing and the quality of recyclates. Several car recycling scenarios have been evaluated using the fundamental recycling system optimisation model. The results reveal the influence of legislatively required recycling/recovery quotas and recycling system architecture on the environmental benefits of recycling. The results suggest that legislation does not represent the best exergy and resource efficiency of the system supporting the view that the present stringent legislation for end-of-life vehicle recycling is violating fundamental thermodynamics. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Then, the various algebraic techniques of exergy costing were analyzed and critiqued, generally by considering successive publications developing and/or based on a technique. This paper, on the other hand, is devoted primarily to calculus methods. Of course the algebraic and calculus techniques do relate to each other, and those relationships are developed here. Furthermore, general concepts, discussion and conclusions which are relevant to both algebraic and calculus methods are presented, along with suggestions regarding further research.},

The new feature of the present work is to extend the applications of exergy analysis to resource and waste accounting and to present the results in an integrated analytical framework, namely, life-cycle analysis (LCA). We conclude that exergy is appropriate for general statistical use, both as a measure of resource stocks and flows and as a measure of waste emissions and potential for causing environmental harm.},

@article{Kestin1980,
abstract = {After a brief historical introduction, this paper proceeds to derive expressions for the available work of a thermodynamic system while the latter interacts with the passive environment. The passive environment is modelled as a union of three idealized reservoirs — energy, volume, and matter. The available work is defined as the optimum amount — largest or smallest — exchanged in circumstances given a prescribed initial and final state of the system. Two types of systems are studied — closed systems and open flow systems — and the interaction is progressively enlarged to include the transfer of heat, the transfer of work, and the transfer of matter. Available work is the difference between the exergy of states 1 and 2; the exergy of a state being defined as the optimum work achieveable against a final state which is one of equilibrium with the surroundings. It is shown that exergy so defined is not a unique quantity for a given system and state, because it also depends on the kind of interaction permitted and therefore on the kind of equilibrium achieved. Exergy, and not energy, is found to represent the preferred measure of a system's “capacity to perform work”. Remarks are made about the contemporary terminology of this field, and regrets are expressed concerning the present day proliferation of terms.},

abstract = {Recently, signficant attention has been directed towards the use of exergy analysis in the assessment of thermal and other industrial processes and their environmental impacts since exergy analysis is an e!ective tool both for achieving efficient energy utilization with minimum (or zero) environmental impact and for understanding environmental issues. In this study, the concepts of exergy analysis and the linkages between exergy and environmental impact are discussed, and several issues regarding the exergies of waste emissions are addressed. Exergy is a measure of the degree of disequilibrium between a substance and its environment. The relations between several measures of environmental impact potential and exergy are investigated by comparing current methods used to assess the environmental impact potential of waste emissions and the exergy associated with those emissions. A case study is presented, to highlight the information revealed using exergy, in which the measures of environmental impact potential considered are the Ontario Ministry of Environment's schedule of industrial air emission limits, and two methods of assessing the environmental costs for air emissions resulting from the combustion of three common fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas.},

abstract = {The exergy of an energy form or a substance is a measure of its usefulness or quality or potential to cause change. A thorough understanding of exergy and the insights it can provide into the efficiency, environmental impact and sustainability of energy systems, are required for the engineer or scientist working in the area of energy systems and the environment. Further, as energy policies play an increasingly important role in addressing sustainability issues and a broad range of local, regional and global environmental concerns, policy makers also need to appreciate the exergy concept and its ties to these concerns. During the past decade, the need to understand the connections between exergy and energy, sustainable development and environmental impact has become increasingly significant. In this paper, a study of these connections is presented in order to provide to those involved in energy and environment studies, useful insights and direction for analyzing and solving environmental problems of varying complexity using the exergy concept. The results suggest that exergy provides the basis for an effective measure of the potential of a substance or energy form to impact the environment and appears to be a critical consideration in achieving sustainable development.},

We conducted the first global survey of the large cities' water sources, and show that previous global hydrologic models that ignored urban water infrastructure significantly overestimated urban water stress. Large cities obtain 78±3{\%} of their water from surface sources, some of which are far away: cumulatively, large cities moved 504 billion liters a day (184km3yr-1) a distance of 27,000±3800km, and the upstream contributing area of urban water sources is 41{\%} of the global land surface. Despite this infrastructure, one in four cities, containing {\$}4.8±0.7 trillion in economic activity, remain water stressed due to geographical and financial limitations. The strategic management of these cities' water sources is therefore important for the future of the global economy. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {A comprehensive set of metrics quantifying sustainability and cost effectiveness of urban water systems is required to rigorously inform policy, design and management decisions, as cities all over the world face the combined pressures of drought and flood, climatic uncertainty, rising population, and an increasingly complex wastewater. These metrics need to be generated using an integrated system approach covering the whole urban water cycle, be capable of assessing a wide range of scenarios including innovations, be able simulate system metric dynamics at a range of time steps including sub-daily, and to create a comprehensive set of technical, economic and environmental variables. A dynamic system engineering modelling framework has been developed to provide a comprehensive set of dynamic performance metrics, integrating all six subsystems of the water cycle viz. (a) water supply; (b) urban water consumers; (c) industrial water consumers (e.g. metallurgical, plastics, construction, recycling industries also as processor or residues); (d) agricultural water consumers; (e) stormwater generation and treatment; and (f) sewerage and wastewater treatment. Dynamic material, component and energy balances, thermodynamics and kinetics, along with life cycle assessment and process economics enable the following variables to be simultaneously throughout the integrated water system viz. water, wastewater, rainfall, stormwater; dissolved constituents (e.g. BOD, TN); embodied energy of system/structures, energy consumed and generated; dynamic environmental impacts and greenhouse gas emissions (arising from water, wastewater, stormwater, dissolved constituents, reagents, infrastructure materials, sludge processing, recycling of materials, direct greenhouse gas emissions, energy); and financial costs (operating and capital). The novel framework has been applied to an innovative urban case study site; a MATLAB/Simulink?? simulation model linked to Simapro ?? data compares infrastructure scales at the site viz. (a) conventional city-scale infrastructure; (b) suburban-scale infrastructure with dual reticulation of potable and recycled water to every house; and (c) household-scale infrastructure, where each house has a grey water recycling unit. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Many articles have touted the diverse potential applications of AnMBR in various stream treatment, and membrane fouling issues. In current review, the fundamentals of AnMBR (including advantages and configurations, membrane materials and modules, and history development), application development in various stream treatment, and membrane fouling researches are summarized and critically assessed. The characteristics of AnMBR and aerobic MBR for wastewater treatment are also compared. AnMBR technology appears to be suitable for treatment of various streams, especially for food industrial wastewater and municipal wastewater. AnMBR treatment usually encounters more serious membrane fouling problem. This, however, can be remedied through various conventional and novel membrane fouling control or cleaning measures. Based on the review, future research perspectives relating to its application and membrane fouling research are proposed.},

abstract = {We are all part of a global economy, capable of producing and transporting seemingly anything, from anywhere, to anyone. Its lifeblood is an interconnected network of suppliers and producers, retailers and consumers, spanning the planet. But the public typically knows far more about Apple, Nike, and other brands than the logistics empires many tiers below, where firms such as Foxconn and Pou Chen connect vast underlying commodity and labor markets that are relatively hidden from the public eye. This sprawling web of supply chains can raise living standards, improve conditions for workers, and help alleviate poverty. But feeding its unquenchable thirst for energy, water, and other resources puts a strain on the planet. Finding ways to relieve that strain is an enormous challenge and will undoubtedly require greater traceability and transparency.  Ports like Hong Kong (above) and warehouses like Amazon's (below) feed global supply chains, but their social and environmental costs are largely hidden. "PHOTO: {\textcopyright} VICTOR FRAILE/CORBIS"  One step forward is providing better measurements and models and making efforts to standardize and coordinate their use. Researchers are intensely studying how to account for supply-chain demands on ecosystems by integrating carbon, water, energy, and other “footprints” into coordinated schemes (see Hoekstra and Wiedmann, p. 1114). They are also developing better ways to inventory material and energy inputs, from the conception of a product to its grave, via life-cycle assessment tools (see Hellweg and Mil{\`{a}} i Canals, p. 1109).  Yet academic insights alone cannot solve these problems. The large-scale cooperation of industry is essential. Many companies and industries are seeking to improve how they collect, synthesize, standardize, and communicate supply-chain data to better inform decision-making (see O'Rourke, p. 1124). A study of the Brazilian Amazon shows how supply-chain initiatives in the beef and soy industries, interacting with economic, social, and policy drivers, can slow deforestation of one of the world's major sources of biodiversity and carbon sequestration (see Nepstad et al., p. 1118). Online  Podcast at www.sciencemag.org/special/supply  Logistics and transportation are also ripe for improvement. One approach is drawing inspiration from the digital Internet to create a Physical Internet. The initiative envisions using standardized “packets” and protocols for shipping, and forging the types of industry-wide partnerships that are normally anathema to a free-market system, but perhaps necessary to reduce the congestion, pollution, and inefficiency that make the current system ultimately unsustainable (see Mervis, p. 1104). Although many companies may initially be motivated by improved efficiencies and profit margins, such improvements in supply chains hold out the hope of improving conditions for humanity (see Dooley, p. 1108). },

abstract = {This study presents a mathematical programming formulation for the design of water and heat exchangers networks based on a two-step methodology. First, an MILP (mixed integer linear programming) procedure is used to solve the water and energy allocation problem regarding several objectives. The first step of the design method involves four criteria to be taken into account., ie, fresh water consumption (F 
                        1), energy consumption (F 
                        2), interconnection number (F 
                        3) and number of heat exchangers (F 
                        4). The multiobjective optimization Min [F 
                        1, F 
                        2] is solved by the so-called $\epsilon$-constraint method and leads to several Pareto fronts for fixed numbers of connections and heat exchangers. The second step consists in improving the best results of the first phase with energy integration into the water network. This stage is solved by an MINLP procedure in order to minimize an objective cost function. Two examples reported in the dedicated literature serve as test bench cases to apply the proposed two-step approach. The results show that the simultaneous consideration of the abovementioned objectives is more realistic than the only minimization of fresh water consumption. Indeed, the optimal network does not necessarily correspond to the structure that reaches the fresh water target. For a real paper mill plant, energy consumption decreases of almost 20{\%} as compared with previous studies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Nearly 3 billion additional urban dwellers are forecasted by 2050, an unprecedented wave of urban growth. While cities struggle to provide water to these new residents, they will also face equally unprecedented hydrologic changes due to global climate change. Here we use a detailed hydrologic model, demographic projections, and climate change scenarios to estimate per-capita water availability for major cities in the developing world, where urban growth is the fastest. We estimate the amount of water physically available near cities and do not account for problems with adequate water delivery or quality. Modeled results show that currently 150 million people live in cities with perennial water shortage, defined as having less than 100 L per person per day of sustainable surface and groundwater flow within their urban extent. By 2050, demographic growth will increase this figure to almost 1 billion people. Climate change will cause water shortage for an additional 100 million urbanites. Freshwater ecosystems in river basins with large populations of urbanites with insufficient water will likely experience flows insufficient to maintain ecological process. Freshwater fish populations will likely be impacted, an issue of special importance in regions such as India's Western Ghats, where there is both rapid urbanization and high levels of fish endemism. Cities in certain regions will struggle to find enough water for the needs of their residents and will need significant investment if they are to secure adequate water supplies and safeguard functioning freshwater ecosystems for future generations.},

abstract = {Cities and regions depend on resources and ecological services from distant ecosystems. The well-being of city and region residents is affected by both the health and availability of these ecosystems, especially in today's ecologically strained world. The management of a city or region's resource metabolism, including the natural capital that supports these flows, is becoming increasingly a central concern to cities and regions that want to succeed. Urban infrastructure is long-lasting and influences resource needs for decades to come: which cities are building future resource traps, and which are opportunities for resource-efficient and more competitive lifestyles? Reliable measures comparing the supply of natural capital to human demand are indispensable for managing resource metabolism, as they help identify challenges, set targets, track progress and drive policies for sustainability. This paper describes one such measurement tool: the Ecological Footprint. After explaining the assumptions behind the Footprint and describing some representative findings, it provides examples of how this resource accounting tool can assist local governments in managing their ecological assets, and support their sustainability efforts.},

Recent research, however, suggests that cities are complex systems that mainly grow from the bottom up, their size and shape following well-defined scaling laws that result from intense competition for space. An integrated theory of how cities evolve, linking urban economics and transportation behavior to developments in network science, allometric growth, and fractal geometry, is being slowly developed. This science provides new insights into the resource limits facing cities in terms of the meaning of density, compactness, and sprawl, and related questions of sustainability. It has the potential to enrich current approaches to city planning and replace traditional top-down strategies with realistic city plans that benefit all city dwellers.},

abstract = {Thermoelectric generation contributes to 80{\%} of global electricity production. Cooling of thermoelectric plants is often achieved by water abstractions from the natural environment. In England and Wales, the electricity sector is responsible for approximately half of all water abstractions and 40{\%} of non-tidal surface water abstractions. We present a model that quantifies current water use of the UK electricity sector and use it to test six decarbonisation pathways to 2050. The pathways consist of a variety of generation technologies, with associated cooling methods, water use factors and cooling water sources. We find that up to 2030, water use across the six pathways is fairly consistent and all achieve significant reductions in both carbon and water intensity, based upon a transition to closed loop and hybrid cooling systems. From 2030 to 2050 our results diverge. Pathways with high levels of carbon capture and storage result in freshwater consumption that exceeds current levels (37-107{\%}), and a consumptive intensity that is 30-69{\%} higher. Risks to the aquatic environment will be intensified if generation with carbon capture and storage is clustered. Pathways of high nuclear capacity result in tidal and coastal abstraction that exceed current levels by 148-399{\%}. Whilst reducing freshwater abstractions, the marine environment will be impacted if a shortage of coastal sites leads to clustering of nuclear reactors and concentration of heated water discharges. The pathway with the highest level of renewables has both lowest abstraction and consumption of water. Freshwater consumption can also be minimised through use of hybrid cooling, which despite marginally higher costs and emissions, would reduce dependence on scarce water resources thus increase security of supply. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {AbstractNational infrastructure systems (energy, transport, digital communications, water, and waste) provide essential services to society. Although for the most part these systems developed in a piecemeal way, they are now an integrated and highly interdependent “system of systems.” However, understanding the long-term performance trajectory of national infrastructure has proved to be very difficult because of the complexity of these systems (in physical and institutional terms) and because there is little tradition of thinking cross-sectorally about infrastructure system performance. Here, a methodology is proposed for analyzing national multisectoral infrastructure systems performance in the context of uncertain futures, incorporating interdependencies in demand across sectors. Three contrasting strategies are considered for infrastructure provision (capacity intensive, capacity constrained, and decentralized) and multiattribute performance metrics are analyzed in the context of low, medium, and high demographic and economic growth scenarios. The approach is illustrated using Great Britain and provides the basis for the development and testing of long-term strategies for national infrastructure provision. It is especially applicable to mature industrial economics with a large stock of existing infrastructure and challenges of future infrastructure provision.},

abstract = {Urban areas are considered net consumers of materials and energy, attracting these from the surrounding hinterland and other parts of the planet. The way these flows are transformed and returned to the environment by the city is important for addressing questions of sustainability and the effect of human behavior on the metabolism of the city. The present work explores these questions with the use of systems analysis, specifically in the form of a Multi-sectoral Systems Analysis (MSA), a tool for research and for supporting decision-making for policy and investment. The application of MSA is illustrated in the context of Greater London, with these three objectives: (a) estimating resource fluxes (nutrients, water and energy) entering, leaving and circulating within the city-watershed system; (b) revealing the synergies and antagonisms resulting from various combinations of water-sector innovations; and (c) estimating the economic benefits associated with implementing these technologies, from the point of view of production of fertilizer and energy, and the reduction of greenhouse gases. Results show that the selection of the best technological innovation depends on which resource is the focus for improvement. Urine separation can potentially recover 47{\%} of the nitrogen in the food consumed in London, with revenue of {\$}33M per annum from fertilizer production. Collecting food waste in sewers together with growing algae in wastewater treatment plants could beneficially increase the amount of carbon release from renewable energy by 66{\%}, with potential annual revenues of {\$}58M from fuel production. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Membrane bioreactor technology (MBR) a combination of the activated sludge process with micro- and ultrafiltration is widely regarded as an effective tool for industrial water treatment and water reuse due to its high product water quality and low footprint. Due to their robustness and flexibility submerged MBR systems are more and more preferred. This paper highlights two case studies for industrial application in a commercial laundry and in a textile factory. A large-scale integrated water reuse process based on MBR+RO technology (capacity 200 m 3/d) has been designed and established in a German laundry within an EC funded project eventually resulting in a reuse ratio of around 80{\%} of the total wastewater. The process was in full operation at the beginning of 2007 and has been operated economically since that time without any failure. Within another EC funded project a small-scale MBR (capacity up to 0.4 m 3/d) has been successfully tested in a Chinese textile factory. Despite high concentration of low biodegradable chemical in the wastewater, the COD removal rate achieved around 90{\%}. However, the MBR permeate quality was not as high as in the laundry due to remaining colored dyestuff what makes an additional treatment step such as nanofiltration or reverse osmosis necessary in order to increase the proportion of reused water. In order to improve rejection of low molecular weight organics Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences and the Institute of Membrane Technology have started a new EC funded project within a consortium of 11 partners in total which aims at developing novel membrane materials providing a basis for the development of a NF MBR reactor. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Cost analysis of the full-scale SAnMBR system showed that membrane costs and gas scouring energy accounted for the largest fraction of total life cycle capital costs and operational costs, respectively. The operational costs can be totally offset by the benefits from biogas recovery. Sensitive analysis showed that membrane parameters including flux, price and lifetime play decisive roles in determining the total life cycle costs of the SAnMBR.

The methane recovery efficiency obtained at 20. °C (53.6{\%}) was slightly lower than at 33. °C (57.4{\%}) due to a reduction of the treatment efficiency, as evidenced by the lower methane production and the higher waste sludge per litre of treated wastewater.

In many parts of the world, direct solar radiation is considered to be one of the most prospective sources of energy. However, the large-scale utilisation of this form of energy is possible only if the effective technology for its storage can be developed with acceptable capital and running costs. One of prospective techniques of storing solar energy is the application of phase change materials (PCMs). Unfortunately, prior to the large-scale practical application of this technology, it is necessary to resolve numerous problems at the research and development stage. This paper looks at the current state of research in this particular field, with the main focus being on the assessment of the thermal properties of various PCMs, methods of heat transfer enhancement and design configurations of heat storage facilities to be used as a part of solar passive and active space heating systems, greenhouses and solar cooking. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The analyses were performed on 3 days in October. It was observed that the average net energy and exergy efficiencies are 45{\%} and 2.2{\%}, respectively. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The performance of a compact phase change material (PCM) solar collector based on latent heat storage was investigated. In this collector, the absorber plate-container unit performs the function of both absorbing the solar energy and storing PCM. The solar energy was stored in paraffin wax, which was used as a PCM, and was discharged to cold water flowing in pipes located inside the wax. The collector's effective area was assumed to be 1 m2 and its total volume was divided into 5 sectors. The experimental apparatus was designed to simulate one of the collector's sectors, with an apparatus-absorber effective area of 0.2 m2. Outdoor experiments were carried out to demonstrate the applicability of using a compact solar collector for water heating. The time-wise temperatures of the PCM were recorded during the processes of charging and discharging. The solar intensity was recorded during the charging process. Experiments were conducted for different water flow rates of 8.3-21.7 kg/h. The effect of the water flow rate on the useful heat gain (Qu) was studied. The heat transfer coefficients were calculated for the charging process. The propagation of the melting and freezing front was also studied during the charging and discharging processes. The experimental results showed that in the charging process, the average heat transfer coefficient increases sharply with increasing the molten layer thickness, as the natural convection grows strong. In the discharge process, the useful heat gain was found to increase as the water mass flow rate increases. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Using the city of Toronto as a case study, this article examines impacts of energy stocks and flexible demand in the urban metabolism on the resilience of the city, including discussion of directions for further study of the resiliency of the urban metabolism. An important element developed is the nominal residence time of the energy stocks. This value defines how long an energy stock lasts under typical patterns of energy use. The findings suggest that the residence times of many sources of energy overcome vulnerability when energy supply shocks last on the order of hours or a few days, but that the measure is limited to assessing only certain types of commonly used energy sources in aggregate terms. Discussion is included on the uncertainty of this measure and on the metabolic and resiliency implications of new technologies intended to reduce energy use and improve sustainability of cities and the use of the urban metabolism as a means of comparison. The methodology employed highlights how waste energy could be used to increase the resiliency of the city's water supply, but also how the study of the urban metabolism would benefit from a more disaggregate form in the study of sustainable and resilient cities.},

abstract = {Network Theory: A Key to Unraveling How Nature Works In the last two decades, network theory has emerged as a way of making sense of everything from the World Wide Web to the human brain. Now, as ecologists have begun applying this theory to ecosystems, they are gaining insights into how species are interconnected and how to foster biodiversity. by carl zimmer Ecologists who want to save the world's biodiversity could learn a lot from Kevin Bacon. One evening in 1994, three college students in Pennsylvania were watching Bacon in the eminently forgettable basketball movie The Air Up There. They started thinking about all the movies Bacon had starred in, and all the actors he had worked with, and all the actors those actors had worked with. The students came up with a game they called Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, counting the steps from Bacon to any actor in Hollywood. In general, it takes remarkably few steps to reach him. Even Charlie Chaplin, who made most of his movies decades before Bacon was born, was only three steps away. (Chaplin starred with Barry Norton in Monsieur Verdoux, Norton starred with Robert Wagner in What Price Glory, and Wagner and Bacon worked together in Wild Things.) Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon became a 1990s sensation, complete with talk show appearances and a book deal. University of Virginia computer scientists got on the bandwagon as well, building a web site called The Oracle of Bacon. You can use it to analyze the connections between all 1.6 million actors listed in the Internet Movie Database. It reveals that all actors in Hollywood are connected to Bacon on average by just 2.95 steps. But it turns out that Bacon is not so remarkable. Over 1,000 actors are linked to the rest of Hollywood by less then three links. And even the most obscure actors can be linked to everyone else in Hollywood by less than ten steps. Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon says less about Bacon, in other words, than it does about the organization of the Hollywood network. If you were to simply join 1.6 million actors to each other at random, it would take many more links to connect any two of them than in real life. Mathematicians call this intimate linkage a “small-world network.” And physicist Albert-Laso Barabasi of the University of Notre Dame and his colleagues have discovered that Hollywood actors are not unique in Scientists hope to use network theory to help them prevent the collapse of ecosystems. forming a small-world network. The World Wide Web is organized in the same way. So is the anatomy of the human brain. What's more, all these networks get their small-world organization because they follow similar rules. In each network, most nodes are linked to only a few other nodes. But a small fraction of nodes have lots of links. These hubs shorten the paths between all the nodes in the entire network. Over the past two decades, Barabasi and other researchers have developed a sophisticated theory of networks that helps make sense of what look at first like hopelessly intricate tangles. Network theory is allowing scientists to understand how networks produce unexpected kinds of behavior you wouldn't be able to predict from looking at individual parts, from the remarkable robustness of the Internet to the sudden crash of financial markets. In the past few years, ecologists have begun to apply network theory to nature. By mapping the connections between species, they are discovering some of the rules by which all ecological networks are organized, and how these rules help foster biodiversity. They're also studying how biological invasions, overfishing, and other threats are reorganizing these networks, and possibly putting them at risk of collapse. By discovering early warning signs of networks in trouble, scientists hope to be able to predict these collapses and prevent them from occurring. Species are joined in an ecological network if they have some kind of relationship. One species may be a predator, and the other its prey. One species may be a tree, and the other a bird that spreads its seeds in its droppings. Ecologists have been well aware of the fact that nature is arranged in networks made up of links between species. Food webs are a common sight in grade-school textbooks, after all. But when the first food webs appeared in the scientific literature in the early 1900s, they were not supposed to be complete roadmaps of ecological networks. Instead, they were cartoons that illustrated some of the new concepts emerging at the time. One of the most important of those concepts was that plants and other photosynthetic organisms served as the foundation of life on Earth. These If plant species depend on just one pollinator, they are vulnerable to extinction if they lose their partner. photosynthesizers converted the sun's energy into biomass, which then fed other species, which in turn fed still others. These fundamental insights eventually led to important advances in conservation biology. They helped conservation biologists understand, for example, how pesticides and other pollutants ended up so concentrated in the bodies of large predators like polar bears and tuna. For decades, however, the best pictures of ecological networks remained extremely simple. It's a lot harder to record the interactions of all the species in an ecosystem than it is to figure out the links between Web sites. Many ecologists also felt that it might not be worth fleshing out networks in too much detail. As networks became more focused and realistic, ecologists found that they became too complex to make sense of — let alone to yield any rules about ecological networks around the world. But ecologists have started to shed that pessimism in recent years. They have seen how scientists like Barabasi have been able to extract meaningful lessons from full-blown networks. And so ecologists have borrowed these scientific methods to analyze networks without drowning in detail. Pollination Getty Images Bees and flowers are co-evolved ecosystem partners. Their studies have shed new light on the biggest debates in ecology. Most plants, for example, depend on animals of one sort or another to spread their pollen. In some cases, scientists have discovered exquisitely co-evolved partners that specialize only on one another. For example, some flowers keep their nectar in deep recesses that can only be reached by flies with tongues stretching several inches in length. Other pollinators are far less picky, browsing many different species, and there are also flowers that don't rely on a single species of pollinator. Ecologists have argued over which kind of partnership — specialized or generalized — is most important in ecosystems. The answer has important practical significance. If many plant species each depend on just one pollinator, then they are exquisitely vulnerable to extinction if they lose their partner. Jordia Bascompte, an ecologist at the Spanish Research Council, and his colleagues have traveled to a number of ecosystems to catalog the plants animal pollinators visit and which animals visit each plant. The picture is much the same from one ecosystem to another. But that picture doesn't match the simple extremes in the pollination debate. Most animals and plants only form partnerships with a few other species. A few generalist animals and plants interact with many species. Generalists form a highly-linked core of the network, interacting with other generalists. The specialists tend to interact with these generalists rather than with each other, with the result that the pollinator network is arranged around hubs. In other words, a field of wildflowers is a lot like Hollywood. Like Hollywood, there's a lot of competition between the players. A generalist moth, for example, will visit several species of plants in search of food. In some ways, each species of plant might be better off if the moth only visited it and no other species. The moth would spread more of its pollen, and so more of the plants would be able to make seeds. But Bascompte's research suggests that the benefits of the network outweigh any drawbacks. If the other species of plants visited by the moth Network theory tells scientists that subtle changes to complex networks can trigger sudden changes. can thrive, that means that the moths have nectar to eat. And that means they can make more moths—which in turn can make more visits to every individual plant species. By modeling these kinds of interactions, Bascompte has found that the small-world network of pollinators and plants fosters more biodiversity than other kinds of networks. This arrangement not only fosters more biodiversity, but also makes ecological networks better able to withstand assaults. Losing a single species is unlikely to bring ecosystems crashing down, because most species in an ecological network are only linked to a few other species. As a result, its absence will have relatively small effect. On the other hand, if a hub species becomes extinct, there may be big trouble. Recently, Bascompte and his colleagues drew the network of marine ecosystems in the Caribbean. They discovered that fish form interconnected clusters known as modules. In each module, the nodes are more connected to each other than to other nodes outside the module. Each module was organized around sharks, which acted as the top predators. Some modules contained a few species of sharks, but many included just one. The sharks may sort themselves into different modules as they avoid competing with one another for fish.

abstract = {Cities are considered major contributors to global warming, where carbon emissions are highly embedded in the overall urban metabolism. To examine urban metabolic processes and emission trajectories we developed a carbon flux model based on Network Environ Analysis (NEA). The mutual interactions and control situation within the urban ecosystem of Vienna were examined, and the system-level properties of the city's carbon metabolism were assessed. Regulatory strategies to minimize carbon emissions were identified through the tracking of the possible pathways that affect these emission trajectories. Our findings suggest that indirect flows have a strong bearing on the mutual and control relationships between urban sectors. The metabolism of a city is considered self-mutualistic and sustainable only when the local and distal environments are embraced. Energy production and construction were found to be two factors with a major impact on carbon emissions, and whose regulation is only effective via ad-hoc pathways. In comparison with the original life-cycle tracking, the application of NEA was better at revealing details from a mechanistic aspect, which is crucial for informed sustainable urban management.},

Developed over the second half of the twentieth century, they are now seeing increased relevance in the face of stringent climate policy, energy security and economic development concerns, and increasing challenges due to the changing nature of the twenty-first century energy system. In this paper, we look particularly at models relevant to national and international energy policy, grouping them into four categories: energy systems optimization models, energy systems simulation models, power systems and electricity market models, and qualitative and mixed-methods scenarios. We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities. In discussing these challenges, we present possible avenues for future research and make recommendations to ensure the continued relevance for energy systems models as important sources of information for policy-making. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The human population is rapidly urbanizing, leading many observers to conclude that humans are leaving nature and the countryside behind. This is a perceptual error consistent with the technological optimism inherent in the prevailing expansionist cultural worldview. By contrast, ecological analysis reveals that modern cities are actually increasingly dependent on the goods and services of nature. This fact is merely obscured by technology and urbanization itself. Typical high-income cities appropriate the productive and assimilative capacity of a vast and increasingly global hinterland, resulting in an ‘ecological footprint' several hundred times larger than the areas they physically occupy. In the next 27 years, the urban population alone is expected to grow by the equivalent of the total human population in the 1930s. This will double the 1970s urban presence on the Earth. Unfortunately, the conventional development path is biophysically unsustainable, calling for a radical transformation of our thinking about urban form and function. Buildings account for 40{\%} of the materials and about a third of the energy consumed by the world economy. Combined with ecocity design principles, green building technologies therefore have the potential to make an enormous contribution to a required 50{\%} reduction in the energy and material intensity of consumption globally. The needed dematerialization increases to 90{\%} in the high-income countries. Such enormous gains in material productivity are unlikely in the absence of significant ecological fiscal (tax) reform. Ironically, then, the most effective path to green buildings and ecocities may be intensive lobbying for higher taxes on primary energy and materials. La population de la Terre est en voie d'urbanisation rapide, ce qui am{\`{e}}ne de nombreux observateurs {\`{a}} conclure que l'homme abandonne la nature et la campagne. Cette erreur de perception va de pair avec l'optimisme technologique inh{\'{e}}rent {\`{a}} la mondialisation culturelle et {\`{a}} l'expansionnisme qui pr{\'{e}}valent aujourd'hui. Or, l'analyse {\'{e}}cologique fait appara{\^{i}}tre, au contraire, que les villes modernes sont en expansion dans un contexte de d{\'{e}}pendance vis-{\`{a}}-vis des biens et des services que procure la nature. Mais cette situation est tout simplement escamot{\'{e}}e par la technologie et l'urbanisation. Les villes {\`{a}} revenus {\'{e}}lev{\'{e}}s s'approprient la capacit{\'{e}} de production et d'assimilation d'une vaste zone fonctionnelle globale, en expansion, qui se traduit par une ‘empreinte {\'{e}}cologique' dont la surface d{\'{e}}passe de plusieurs centaines de fois la surface que ces villes occupent r{\'{e}}ellement. Dans les 27 prochaines ann{\'{e}}es, la population urbaine seule devrait voir passer ses effectifs {\`{a}} un nombre {\'{e}}quivalent {\`{a}} la population totale du globe de 1930. Ainsi, la part que repr{\'{e}}sentaient les villes dans les ann{\'{e}}es 1970 va-t-elle se trouver doubl{\'{e}}e. Malheureusement, la fili{\`{e}}re du d{\'{e}}veloppement classique n'est pas durable sur le plan biophysique et appelle une transformation radicale de notre mani{\`{e}}re de penser en termes de formes et de fonctions urbaines. Les b{\^{a}}timents utilisent 40{\%} des mat{\'{e}}riaux et environ un tiers de l'{\'{e}}nergie consomm{\'{e}}s par l'{\'{e}}conomie mondiale. Associ{\'{e}}es aux principes de conception de cit{\'{e}}s {\'{e}}cologiques, les technologies des ‘b{\^{a}}timents verts' devraient permettre d'atteindre l'objectif vis{\'{e}} au niveau de la plan{\`{e}}te qui est de r{\'{e}}duire de 50{\%} la consommation d'{\'{e}}nergie et l'utilisation de mat{\'{e}}riaux. Cette d{\'{e}}mat{\'{e}}rialisation n{\'{e}}cessaire passe {\`{a}} 90{\%} dans les pays {\`{a}} hauts revenus. En l'absence de toute r{\'{e}}forme significative de la fiscalit{\'{e}} {\'{e}}cologique, de tels gains de productivit{\'{e}} paraissent impossibles {\`{a}} atteindre.

abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated the possibility of maintaining a reliable electric power system with high shares of renewables, but only assuming the deployment of specific technologies in precise ratios, careful demand-side management, or grid-scale storage technologies. Any scalable renewable technology that could provide either baseload or dispatchable power would allow greater flexibility in planning a balanced system, and therefore would be especially valuable. Many analysts have suggested that concentrating solar power (CSP) could do just that. Here we systematically test this proposition for the first time. We simulate the operation of CSP plant networks incorporating thermal storage in four world regions where CSP is already being deployed, and optimize their siting, operation and sizing to satisfy a set of realistic demand scenarios. In all four regions, we show that with an optimally designed and operated system, it is possible to guarantee up to half of peak capacity before CSP plant costs substantially increase.},

abstract = {Purpose The industrial ecosystem identified in and around the Campbell Industrial Park in Honolulu County, Hawai'i involves 11 facilities exchanging water, materials, and en-ergy across an industrial cluster. This paper highlights the advantages of this arrangement using life cycle assessment to determine the energy and environmental costs and bene-fits of the existing pattern of exchanges. Methods A consequential approach was used to evaluate each material substitution for four environmental impact categories: primary energy use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, acidification, and eutrophication. Each material exchange included avoided production and reduced use of virgin materials, any necessary pre-processing or transpor-tation of local by-products, and avoided treatment or dis-posal of these by-products. Results and discussion All exchanges exhibited positive net savings across all environmental impact categories, with the exceptions of waste oil and tire-derived fuel burned as sub-stitutes for coal. The greatest savings occur as a result of sharing steam between a combined cycle fuel oil-fired co-generation plant and a nearby refinery. In total, the environ-mental savings realized by this industrial cluster are signif-icant, equivalent to 25 {\%} of the state's policy goal for reducing the industrial component of GHG emissions over the next decade. The role of policy in supporting material and energy exchanges is also discussed as the central cluster of two power plants and two refineries share steam and water in part under regulatory requirements. Conclusions The results show environmental benefits of the sharing of by-product resources accrued on a life cycle basis, while for the local context, the reduction of imported fuels and materials helps to reduce the external dependency of Oahu's remote island economy. The environmental ben-efits of materials exchanges are often ignored in energy policy, though, as in this case, they can represent consider-able savings.},

abstract = {Industrial symbiosis examines cooperative management of resource flows through networks of businesses known in the literature as industrial ecosystems. These industrial ecosystems have previously been portrayed as having characteristics of complex adaptive systems, but with insufficient attention to the internal and external phenomena describing their genesis. Drawing on biological, ecological, organizational, and systems theory, a discontinuous three-stage model of industrial symbiosis is presented. The model proceeds from a random formative stage involving numerous actors engaging in material and energy exchanges, to conscious recognition and intentional pursuit of network benefits, to institutionalization of beliefs and norms enabling successful collaborative behavior. While there is much variation, with no single path to this outcome, the recognition of benefits is seen as an emergent property characteristic of these self-organized systems that move beyond the initial stage.},

This is the reason why the number of geothermal and biomass fired power plants based on this technology have been increased within the last years. The favourable characteristics of ORC make them suitable for being integrated in applications like solar desalination with reverse osmosis system, waste heat recovery from biogas digestion plants or micro-CHP systems. In this paper, the state of the art of ORC applications will be presented together with innovative systems which have been simulated in a process simulation environment using experimental data.

abstract = {An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) machine is similar to a conventional steam cycle energy conversion system, but uses an organic fluid such as refrigerants and hydrocarbons instead of water. In recent years, research was intensified on this device as it is being progressively adopted as premier technology to convert low-temperature heat resources into power. Available heat resources are: solar energy, geothermal energy, biomass products, surface seawater, and waste heat from various thermal processes. This paper presents existing applications and analyzes their maturity. Binary geothermal and binary biomass CHP are already mature. Provided the interest to recover waste heat rejected by thermal devices and industrial processes continue to grow, and favorable legislative conditions are adopted, waste heat recovery organic Rankine cycle systems in the near future will experience a rapid growth. Solar modular power plants are being intensely investigated at smaller scale for cogeneration applications in buildings but larger plants are also expected in tropical or Sahel regions with constant and low solar radiation intensity. OTEC power plants operating mainly on offshore installations at very low temperature have been advertised as total resource systems and interest on this technology is growing in large isolated islands. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The UK Water Industry currently generates approximately 800. GW. h pa of electrical energy from sewage sludge. Traditionally energy recovery from sewage sludge features Anaerobic Digestion (AD) with biogas utilisation in combined heat and power (CHP) systems. However, the industry is evolving and a number of developments that extract more energy from sludge are either being implemented or are nearing full scale demonstration. This study compared five technology configurations: 1 - conventional AD with CHP, 2 - Thermal Hydrolysis Process (THP) AD with CHP, 3 - THP AD with bio-methane grid injection, 4 - THP AD with CHP followed by drying of digested sludge for solid fuel production, 5 - THP AD followed by drying, pyrolysis of the digested sludge and use of the both the biogas and the pyrolysis gas in a CHP.The economic and environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) found that both the post AD drying options performed well but the option used to create a solid fuel to displace coal (configuration 4) was the most sustainable solution economically and environmentally, closely followed by the pyrolysis configuration (5). Application of THP improves the financial and environmental performance compared with conventional AD. Producing bio-methane for grid injection (configuration 3) is attractive financially but has the worst environmental impact of all the scenarios, suggesting that the current UK financial incentive policy for bio-methane is not driving best environmental practice. It is clear that new and improving processes and technologies are enabling significant opportunities for further energy recovery from sludge; LCA provides tools for determining the best overall options for particular situations and allows innovation resources and investment to be focused accordingly. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {The reversible reaction between CaO and CO2 is an extremely promising method of removing CO2 from the exhaust of a power station, generating a pure stream of CO2 ready for geological sequestration. The technology has attracted a great deal of attention recently, owing to a number of its advantages: the relatively small efficiency penalty which it imposes upon a power station (estimated at 6-8 percentage points, including compression of the CO2); its potential use in large-scale circulating fluidised beds (a mature technology, as opposed to the vastly upscaled solvent scrubbing towers which would be required for amine scrubbing); its excellent opportunity for integration with cement manufacture (potentially decarbonising both industries) and its extremely cheap sorbent (crushed limestone). Unfortunately, sorbent (CaO) derived from natural limestone markedly decreases in its reactivity over a number of cycles of reaction with CO2. Much current and promising research involves the investigation of a number of different methods to either reduce the rate of decay in reactivity, to boost the long-term reactivity of the sorbent or to reactivate the sorbent. Technologies investigated include thermal pretreatment or chemical doping of natural sorbents and the production of artificial sorbents. Attrition of the limestone can be a problem during repeated cycling in, e.g. a circulating fluidised bed, and some of the strategies to enhance the long-term capacity of the limestone to take up CO2 can increase attrition. Strategies to counteract attrition, such as pelletisation of highly reactive materials, have succeeded in reducing, though not eliminating, this problem. Each of these topics is reviewed in detail here, as are potential competing reactions with sulphurous compounds and the large-scale integration of the calcium looping cycle with both a power station and a cement works, including a number of assessments of the economics of the cycle. A number of pilot plants demonstrating the technology have been constructed around the world. No major problems have been encountered thus far, and so calcium looping technology is currently moving to the demonstration scale in a number of locations. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The paper assesses the life cycle of biodiesel from used cooking oil (UCO). Such life cycle involves 4 stages: 1) collection, 2) pre-treatment, 3) delivery and 4) transesterification of UCO. Generally, UCO is collected from restaurants, food industries and recycling centres by authorised companies. Then, UCO is pre-treated to remove solid particles and water to increase its quality. After that, it is charged in cistern trucks and delivered to the biodiesel facility to be then transesterified with methanol to biodiesel.  The production of 1 ton of biodiesel is evaluated by a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to assess the environmental impact and by an Exergetic Life Cycle Assessment (ELCA) to account for the exergy input to the system. A detailed list of material and energy inputs is done using data from local companies and completed using Ecoinvent 1.2 database.  The results show that the transesterification stage causes 68{\%} of the total environmental impact. The major exergy inputs are uranium and natural gas. If targets set by the Spanish Renewable Energy Plan are achieved, the exergy input for producing biodiesel would be reduced by 8{\%} in the present system and consequently environmental impacts and exergy input reduced up to 36{\%} in 2010.},

abstract = {In today's world, there is a continuous global need for more energy which, at the same time, has to be cleaner than the energy produced from the traditional generation technologies. This need has facilitated the increasing penetration of distributed generation (DG) technologies and primarily of renewable energy sources (RES). The extensive use of such energy sources in today's electricity networks can indisputably minimize the threat of global warming and climate change. However, the power output of these energy sources is not as reliable and as easy to adjust to changing demand cycles as the output from the traditional power sources. This disadvantage can only be effectively overcome by the storing of the excess power produced by DG-RES. Therefore, in order for these new sources to become completely reliable as primary sources of energy, energy storage is a crucial factor. In this work, an overview of the current and future energy storage technologies used for electric power applications is carried out. Most of the technologies are in use today while others are still under intensive research and development. A comparison between the various technologies is presented in terms of the most important technological characteristics of each technology. The comparison shows that each storage technology is different in terms of its ideal network application environment and energy storage scale. This means that in order to achieve optimum results, the unique network environment and the specifications of the storage device have to be studied thoroughly, before a decision for the ideal storage technology to be selected is taken. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Fermentation of dilute sulfuric acid barley straw hydrolysate (BSH; undiluted/untreated) by Clostridium beijerinckii P260 resulted in the production of 7.09 gL-1 ABE (acetone butanol ethanol), an ABE yield of 0.33, and productivity of 0.10 gL-1 h-1. This level of ABE is much less than that observed in a control experiment (21.06 gL-1) where glucose (initial concentration 60 gL-1) was used as a substrate. In the control experiment, an ABE yield of 0.41 and productivity of 0.31 gL-1 h-1 were observed. This comparison suggested that BSH is toxic to the culture. To reduce this potential toxicity effect, BSH was treated with lime [Ca(OH)2] followed by fermentation. The treated BSH resulted in a successful fermentation and ABE concentration of 26.64 gL-1 was achieved. This was superior to both glucose and untreated BSH (initial sugar 60 gL-1) fermentations. In this fermentation, an ABE yield of 0.43 and productivity of 0.39 gL-1 h-1 (390{\%} of untreated/undiluted BSH) was obtained. It should be noted that using lime treated BSH, a specific productivity of 0.55 h-1 was obtained as compared to 0.12 h-1 in the control fermentation suggesting that more carbon was directed to product formation.},

abstract = {Four experimental columns were employed in this study to investigate their performance under wastewater treatment conditions. One column was set-up as a biological aerated filter and the remaining three were set-up as microbial fuel cells (MFCs), two of which were connected to an external load whereas the third was left open circuit. The performance of the columns under several flow rates and leachate strengths was studied in terms of BOD5 removal efficiencies and electricity generation, when a fixed resistive load was connected. Results obtained demonstrated that it is possible to generate electricity and simultaneously treat landfill leachate in MFC columns. Energy generation in MFC columns improved with increasing flow rates from 24 to 192 mL/h, while BOD5 removal efficiency levels reached a maximum at 48 mL/h and dropped to relatively low values at higher flow rates. The maximum removal efficiencies were obtained at a loading rate of 0.81 kg BOD(5/)m(3) d for columns C1, C2 and C4 and 1.81 kg BOD5/m(3) d for column C3. Electrical output levels and BOD5 concentrations at the MFC columns showed a linear relationship, which allows the system to be used as a BOD5 sensor. Part of the BOD removal was not associated with power generation and was attributed to the presence of alternative end terminal electron acceptors and volatilisation. The MFC columns could reach the same or even higher removal efficiencies than those from the biological aerated filter with the advantage of producing energy and saving cost of aeration. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that compares the MFC technology with other conventional treatment systems for removing pollutants from wastewater.

This process level model is integrated with a lifecycle energy and greenhouse gas emission analysis compatible with the methods and boundaries of the Argonne National Laboratory GREET model, thereby ensuring comparability to preexisting fuel-cycle assessments. Results are used to evaluate the net energy ratio (NER) and net greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) of microalgae biodiesel in comparison to petroleum diesel and soybean-based biodiesel with a boundary equivalent to "well-to-pump". The resulting NER of the microalgae biodiesel process is 0.93 MJ of energy consumed per MJ of energy produced. In terms of net GHGs, microalgae-based biofuels avoids 75 g of CO(2)-equivalent emissions per MJ of energy produced. The scalability of the consumables and products of the proposed microalgae-to-biofuels processes are assessed in the context of 150 billion liters (40 billion gallons) of annual production.},

abstract = {Purpose The aim of this study was to perform a well-to-pump life cycle assessment (LCA) to investigate the overall net energy balance and environmental impact of bioethanol production using Tall Fescue grass straw as feedstock. The energy requirements and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were compared to those of gasoline to explore the potential of bioethanol as sustainable fuel. Methods The functional unit used in the study was 10,000 MJ of energy. The data for grass seed production were collected from the farmers in Oregon and published reports. The compositions of straw, pretreatment, and hydrolysis yields were obtained from laboratory experiments. Process models were developed for ethanol production using different pretreatment technologies in SuperPro Designer to calculate the process energy, raw materials, utility use, and emissions related. The Greenhouse Gases Regulated Emissions and Energy use in Transportation model and other literature studies were used to obtain additional data. Systematic boundary identification was performed using relative mass, energy, and economic value method using a 5{\%} cutoff value. Results and discussion Ethanol yields from grass straw were estimated 256.62, 255.8, 255.3, and 230.2 L/dry metric ton of biomass using dilute acid, dilute alkali, hot water, and steam explosion pretreatments, respectively. Fossil energy required to produce one functional unit was in the range of −1507 to 3940 MJ for different ethanol production techniques. GHG emissions from ethanol LCA models were in the range of −131 to −555.4 kg CO2 eq. per 10,000 MJ of ethanol. Fossil energy use and GHG emissions during ethanol production were found to be lowest for steam explosion pretreatment among all pretreatment processes evaluated. Change in coproduct allocation from economic to mass basis during agricultural production resulted in 62.4{\%} and 133.1{\%} increase in fossil energy use and GHG emissions respectively. Conclusions Technologies used for ethanol production process had major impact on total fossil energy use and GHG emissions. N2O emissions from the nitrogen fertilizers were major contributor (77{\%}) of total GHG emissions produced during agricultural activities. There was 57.43–112.67{\%} reduction in fossil energy use to produce 10,000 MJ of ethanol compared to gasoline; however, about 0.35 ha of land is also required to produce this energy.},

Conventional crops such as corn and sugarcane are unable to meet the global demand of bioethanol production due to their primary value of food and feed.

Bioethanol from agricultural waste could be a promising technology though the process has several challenges and limitations such as biomass transport and handling, and efficient pretreatment methods for total delignification of lignocellulosics. Proper pretreatment methods can increase concentrations of fermentable sugars after enzymatic saccharification, thereby improving the efficiency of the whole process.

While the implications of such exposure scenarios are unknown, concerns have been raised regarding the possibility that continuous discharge of antibiotics to the environment may facilitate the development or proliferation of resistant strains of bacteria. As potable and non-potable water recycling schemes are continuously developed, it is imperative to improve our understanding of the fate of antibiotics during conventional and advanced wastewater treatment processes leading to high-quality water reclamation. This review collates existing knowledge with the aim of providing new insight to the influence of a wide range of treatment processes to the ultimate fate of antibiotics during conventional and advanced wastewater treatment. Although conventional biological wastewater treatment processes are effective for the removal of some antibiotics, many have been reported to occur at 10-1000 ng L-1 concentrations in secondary treated effluents. These include ??-lactams, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and tetracyclines. Tertiary and advanced treatment processes may be required to fully manage environmental and human exposure to these contaminants in water recycling schemes.

abstract = {Hydrogen produced from renewable resources is a promising potential source of clean energy. With the help of low-temperature proton-exchange membrane fuel cells, molecular hydrogen can be converted efficiently to produce electricity. The implementation of sustainable hydrogen production and subsequent hydrogen conversion to energy is called "hydrogen economy". Unfortunately, its physical properties make the transport and handling of hydrogen gas difficult. To overcome this, methanol can be used as a material for the storage of hydrogen, because it is a liquid at room temperature and contains 12.6 per cent hydrogen. However, the state-of-the-art method for the production of hydrogen from methanol (methanol reforming) is conducted at high temperatures (over 200 degrees Celsius) and high pressures (25-50 bar), which limits its potential applications. Here we describe an efficient low-temperature aqueous-phase methanol dehydrogenation process, which is facilitated by ruthenium complexes. Hydrogen generation by this method proceeds at 65-95 degrees Celsius and ambient pressure with excellent catalyst turnover frequencies (4,700 per hour) and turnover numbers (exceeding 350,000). This would make the delivery of hydrogen on mobile devices--and hence the use of methanol as a practical hydrogen carrier--feasible.},

abstract = {Many different photovoltaic technologies are being developed for large-scale solar energy conversion. The wafer-based first-generation photovoltaic devices have been followed by thin-film solid semiconductor absorber layers sandwiched between two charge-selective contacts and nanostructured (or mesostructured) solar cells that rely on a distributed heterojunction to generate charge and to transport positive and negative charges in spatially separated phases. Although many materials have been used in nanostructured devices, the goal of attaining high-efficiency thin-film solar cells in such a way has yet to be achieved. Organometal halide perovskites have recently emerged as a promising material for high-efficiency nanostructured devices. Here we show that nanostructuring is not necessary to achieve high efficiencies with this material: a simple planar heterojunction solar cell incorporating vapour-deposited perovskite as the absorbing layer can have solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies of over 15 per cent (as measured under simulated full sunlight). This demonstrates that perovskite absorbers can function at the highest efficiencies in simplified device architectures, without the need for complex nanostructures.},

The frequency of intense storms that hit northerly areas has increased, but the intensity of cyclones making landfall farther south — from Vietnam to Taiwan — has not measurably changed. The researchers suggest that changing atmospheric- circulation patterns resulting from a gradual warming of the western Pacific Ocean have shifted the areas where cyclones develop, moving them to the north and west.

@article{Lenert2014,
abstract = {The most common approaches to generating power from sunlight are either photovoltaic, in which sunlight directly excites electron–hole pairs in a semiconductor, or solar–thermal, in which sunlight drives a mechanical heat engine. Photovoltaic power generation is intermittent and typically only exploits a portion of the solar spectrum efficiently, whereas the intrinsic irreversibilities of small heat engines make the solar–thermal approach best suited for utility-scale power plants. There is, therefore, an increasing need for hybrid technologies for solar power generation1, 2. By converting sunlight into thermal emission tuned to energies directly above the photovoltaic bandgap using a hot absorber–emitter, solar thermophotovoltaics promise to leverage the benefits of both approaches: high efficiency, by harnessing the entire solar spectrum3, 4, 5; scalability and compactness, because of their solid-state nature; and dispatchablility, owing to the ability to store energy using thermal or chemical means6, 7, 8. However, efficient collection of sunlight in the absorber and spectral control in the emitter are particularly challenging at high operating temperatures. This drawback has limited previous experimental demonstrations of this approach to conversion efficiencies around or below 1{\%} (refs 9, 10, 11). Here, we report on a full solar thermophotovoltaic device, which, thanks to the nanophotonic properties of the absorber–emitter surface, reaches experimental efficiencies of 3.2{\%}. The device integrates a multiwalled carbon nanotube absorber and a one-dimensional Si/SiO2 photonic-crystal emitter on the same substrate, with the absorber–emitter areas optimized to tune the energy balance of the device. Our device is planar and compact and could become a viable option for high-performance solar thermophotovoltaic energy conversion.},

abstract = {The debate on urban sustainability has now been on the research agenda for a number of years. One element that has, however, been undertheorized and empirically understudied is the crucial importance of networked urban infrastructures for the ecological sustainability of cities. These infrastructures mediate resource flows and vitally shape environmental practices and sociotechnical innovation in cities. It is thus argued that we need adequate conceptual approaches which reflect the complex interdependencies between cities, networked infrastructures, and urban ecologies and which broaden our understanding of the ways we can develop, govern, and renew our infrastructures in cities in a sustainable way. Scrutinizing the relevant debates both in technology studies and in urban studies, the author reveals that none of the theoretical approaches discussed seems entirely suitable for conceptualizing these interdependencies and the requirements for the sustainable redesign of urban infrastructures. The author shows, however, how urban and technology studies might inspire, complement, and benefit each other in conceptualizing the urban political ecology of networked infrastructures. Combining elements of the different analytical approaches, it is argued, could create new opportunities for the empirical study of infrastructures.},

abstract = {Transformation of infrastructure systems is understood to be key to developing sustainable, resourceefcient cities (Boyle et al. 2010; Sahely et al. 2005). The framework for urban green growth developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) sees infrastructure, along with innovation and human capital, as being the starting conditions for achieving green jobs, green supply and consumption, and urban attractiveness (Hammer et al. 2011). The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP 2012) identies ve key thematic infrastructure areas for achieving resource efcient citiesbuilding energy efciency, waste management, sustainable urban transport, water/wastewater, and urban ecosystem managementbut stresses that it is integration between sectors and across scales that is most important. Our goal with this special issue on sustainable urban systems is to apply methods of industrial ecology toward the sustainable development of cities, their supporting hinterlands, and the networked infrastructure that connects them. The methods include familiar tools of industrial ecology, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), material ow analysis (MFA), environmental footprinting, and scenario modeling; but there is also an effort to push the interdisciplinary boundaries of in-dustrial ecology even further, linking with other disciplines and recognizing that it is social actors (i.e., people) who shape urban systems. Contributions were encouraged from researchers in a broad range of disciplines, including industrial ecologists, urban ecologists, urban planners, architects, geographers, engineers, economists, environmental scientists, planners, political scientists, and sociologists. The articles address fundamental research, development of cross-cutting conceptual frameworks, applied tools (e.g., lowcarbon development methods), case studies, and interdisciplinary curricula. Several articles in particular address both the biophysical and human dimensions of sustainable urban systems (Castan Broto et al. 2012; Ramaswami et al. 2012b; Hodson et al. 2012). In introducing this special issue, we begin with interdisciplinary overarching articles on urban infrastructure, metabolism, and environmental footprints of cities in the context of social actors, before moving to more specialized articles on energy and carbon, nutrients, water, and waste.},

This paper presents an optimisation approach for the integrated management of water resources, including desalinated seawater, wastewater and reclaimed water, for insular water deficient areas. The proposed mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model takes into account the subdivided regions on the island, the subsequent localised needs for water use (including water quality) and wastewater production, as well as geographical aspects. In addition, the integration of potable and non-potable water systems is considered. The optimal water management decisions, including the location of desalination, wastewater treatment, and reclamation plants, as well as the conveyance infrastructure for desalinated water, wastewater and reclaimed water, are obtained by minimising the annualised total capital and operating costs. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to two Greek islands: Syros and Paros-Antiparos, for case study and scenario analysis. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In addition, most graphical allocation and network design tools that use the cleanest source to satisfy the cleanest demand fail when the flow rate of a demand is met but the mass load is not. This work presents a versatile and generic approach for simultaneous targeting and design of water networks. It includes new heuristics and significant new insights on source and demand allocation composite curves, and it introduces a new visualization tool known as the network allocation diagram (NAD). This approach can generate targets for cases with both flow-rate and mass-load constraints and simultaneously solve complex design problems involving multiple pinches. NAD also allows designers to graphically visualize, explore, evolve, and systematically choose networks that yield either the minimum water targets or the minimum number of streams.},

abstract = {This paper is providing a design and evaluation methodology for biomass utilization networks (B-NETs) planning in local areas. The methodology is an effort to integrate various exertions of many researchers as well as stakeholders in the biomass field including process technologies, local area classification and renewable energy mechanisms to design and evaluate B-NETs. The proposed design methodology has three steps: classification, problem formulation and suggesting solution methods. The core part of planning the B-NETs utilization methodology is the superstructure that is a super class model for the processes of biomass utilization networks that has to be built for the local area. The biomass utilization superstructure (BUSS) relates the biomass resources to their products, available processes, and possible future processes of utilization in static manner. Although the local area BUSS is static in nature, it shows the decision makers what kinds of B-NETs are, or can be, available in their area. It is important to note that for each super class process there exists a number of elemental technologies, or what we call unit process (UP), that can perform the job under the same condition with different processing constraint. To support the design and operation process a technological information infrastructure (TII) needs to be built to work as an information pool and simulation tool. With the support of TII and the BUSS different scenarios can be synthesized, analyzed and compared. Scenarios development enables the designer to check processing alternatives as well as biomass promotion mechanisms that fit the concerns of various stakeholders. The results of the methodology application can be given in the form of suggestions of a specific network class(es) or scenarios that can be applied in a class of localities with the same characteristics. Following to methodology configuration, a proposal for optimization methods is discussed and a case study for comparing biomass network scenarios in mountainous city is introduced. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Water supply systems (WSS) frequently present high-energy consumption values, which correspond to the major expenses of these systems. Energy costs are a function of its real consumption and of the variability of the daily energy tariff. This paper presents a model of optimization for the energy efficiency in a water supply system. The system is equipped with a pump station and presents excess of available energy in the gravity branch. First, a water turbine is introduced in the system in order to use this excess of hydraulic available energy. Then, an optimization method to define the pump operation planning along the 24 h of simulation, as well as the analysis of the economic benefits resulting from the profit of wind energy to supply the water pumping, while satisfying the system constraints and population demands, is implemented, in order to minimize the global operational costs. The model, developed in MATLAB, uses linear programming and provides the planning strategy to take in each time step, which will influence the following hours. The simulation period considered is one day, sub-divided in hourly time steps. The rules obtained as output of the optimization procedures are subsequently introduced in a hydraulic simulator (e.g. EPANET), in order to verify the system behaviour along the simulation period. The results are compared with the normal operating mode (i.e. without optimization algorithm) and show that energy cost's savings are achieved dependently of the initial reservoir levels or volume. The insertion of the water turbine also generates significant economical benefits for the water supply system. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Vairavamoorthy2008,
abstract = {Urban areas of developing countries are facing increasing water scarcity and it is possible that this problem may be further aggravated due to rapid changes in the hydro-environment at different scales, like those of climate and land-cover. Due to water scarcity and limitations to the development of new water resources, it is prudent to shift from the traditional 'supply based management' to a 'demand management' paradigm. Demand management focuses on measures that make better and more efficient use of limited supplies, often at a level significantly below standard service levels. This paper particularly focuses on the intermittent water supplies in the cities of developing countries. Intermittent water supplies need to be adopted due to water scarcity and if not planned properly, results in inequities in water deliveries to consumers and poor levels of service. It is therefore important to recognise these realities when designing and operating such networks. The standard tools available for design of water supply systems often assume a continuous, unlimited supply and the supplied water amount is limited only be the demand, making them unsuitable for designing intermittent supplies that are governed by severely limited water availability. This paper presents details of new guidelines developed for the design and control of intermittent water distribution systems in developing countries. These include a modified network analysis simulation coupled with an optimal design tool. The guidelines are driven by a modified set of design objectives to be met at least cost. These objectives are equity in supply and people driven levels of service (PDLS) expressed in terms of four design parameters namely, duration of the supply; timings of the supply; pressure at the outlet (or flow-rate at outlet); and others such as the type of connection required and the locations of connections (in particular for standpipes). All the four parameters are calculated using methods and techniques that recognise the relationship between outflow at a water connection and the pressure experienced at that connection. The paper presents a case study where it is demonstrated that the new guidelines can provide an equitable and acceptable level of service throughout the design horizon of the project. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Within the framework of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) the nutrient and heavy metal levels within the Kharaa river basin were investigated. By the application of the MONERIS model, which quantifies nutrient emissions into river basins, various point and diffuse pathways, as well as nutrient load in rivers, could be analysed. Despite seasonal variations and inputs of point sources (e.g. Wastewater Treatment Plant Darkhan) the nutrient concentrations in most of the subbasins are on a moderate level. This shows evidence for a nutrient limited ecosystem as well as dilution effects. However, in the middle and lower reaches heavy metal concentrations of arsenic and mercury, which are linked to mining activities in many cases, are a point of concern. Thus measures are necessary to protect the valuable chemical and ecological status of the Kharaa River and its tributaries. As a result of the growing economic pressure Mongolia will enhance the agricultural production by irrigation. Until 2015 about 60{\%} of the agricultural land shall be irrigated. In addition the gold mining activities shall increase by 20{\%} a year. Both sectors have a high demand for water quantity and quality. The model MONERIS allows the assessment of measures which are inevitable to protect the water quality under shrinking water availability.},

The greatest difficulties to any scientific approach to cities have resulted from their many interdependent facets, as social, economic, infrastructural, and spatial complex systems that exist in similar but changing forms over a huge range of scales. Here, I show how all cities may evolve according to a small set of basic principles that operate locally. A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development. Measures of urban efficiency, capturing the balance between socioeconomic outputs and infrastructural costs, were shown to be independent of city size and might be a useful means to evaluate urban planning strategies.},

abstract = {In this study, an interval-parameter superiority-inferiority-based two-stage programming model has been developed for supporting community-scale renewable energy management (ISITSP-CREM). This method is based on an integration of the existing interval linear programming (ILP), two-stage programming (TSP) and superiority-inferiority-based fuzzy-stochastic programming (SI-FSP). It allows uncertainties presented as both probability/possibilistic distributions and interval values to be incorporated within a general optimization framework, facilitating the reflection of multiple uncertainties and complexities during the process of renewable energy management systems planning. ISITSP-CREM can also be used for effectively addressing dynamic interrelationships between renewable energy availabilities, economic penalties and electricity-generation deficiencies within a community scale. Thus, complexities in renewable energy management systems can be systematically reflected, highly enhancing applicability of the modeling process. The developed method has then been applied to a case of long-term renewable energy management planning for three communities. Useful solutions for the planning of renewable energy management systems have been generated. Interval solutions associated with different energy availabilities and economic penalties have been obtained. They can be used for generating decision alternatives and thus help decision makers identify desired policies under various economic and system-reliability constraints. The generated solutions can also provide desired energy resource/service allocation plans with a minimized system cost (or economic penalties), a maximized system reliability level and a maximized energy security. Tradeoffs between system costs and energy security can also be tackled. Higher costs will increase potential energy generation amount, while a desire for lower system costs will run into a risk of energy deficiency. They are helpful for supporting: (a) adjustment or justification of allocation patterns of renewable energy resources and services, (b) formulation of local policies regarding energy utilization, economic development and energy structure under various energy availabilities and policy interventions, and (c) analysis of interactions among economic cost, system reliability and energy-supply shortage. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Ecologically sound development of the region is possible when energy needs are integrated with the environmental concerns at the local and global levels. Taking into account these features, this paper explains the need of DEP and shows how different types of energy planning and optimization models, supply demand models, regional models, resource models and neural models have been carried, adopted and applied at decentralized level. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Operational optimization models are one of the main streams in modeling energy systems. Agent-based modeling and simulation seem to be another approach getting popular in this field. In either optimization or agent-based modeling practices, technological change in energy systems is a very important and inevitable factor that researchers need to deal with. By introducing three stylized models, namely, a traditional optimization model, an optimization model with endogenous technological change, and an agent-based model, all of which were developed based on the same deliberately simplified energy system, this paper compares how technological change is treated differently in different modeling practices for energy systems, the different philosophies underlying them, and the advantages/disadvantages of each modeling practice. Finally, this paper identifies the different contexts suitable for applying optimization models and agent-based models in decision support regarding energy systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Rammel2007,
abstract = {The overexploitation of natural resources and the increasing number of social conflicts following from their unsustainable use point to a wide gap between the objectives of sustainability and current resource management practices. One of the reasons for the difficulties to close this gap is that for evolving complex systems like natural and socio-economic systems, sustainability cannot be a static objective. Instead sustainable development is an open evolutionary process of improving the management of social-ecological systems, through better understanding and knowledge. Therefore, natural resource management systems need to be able to deal with different temporal, spatial and social scales, nested hierarchies, irreducible uncertainty, multidimensional interactions and emergent properties. The co-evolutionary perspective outlined in this paper serves as heuristic device to map the interactions settled in the networks between the resource base, social institutions and the behaviour of individual actors. For this purpose we draw on ideas from complex adaptive systems theory, evolutionary theory and evolutionary economics. Finally, we outline a research agenda for a co-evolutionary approach for natural resource management systems. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) are private-sector instruments that offer energy-/emission-improvement (energy saving, energy efficiency, energy conservation and emission reduction) projects, or renewable-energy projects, in the developed and in some developing countries. There has been an increased interest for the provision of such energy services, driven by a restructuring of the gas and electricity sectors, and the push to mainstream sustainable forms of energy into the market. ESCOs are destined to deliver sustainable-energy solutions, especially in emerging markets. Literature reveals that energy/emission improvements of countries may be related to their innovation- and R{\&}D-activity levels. In this work, we use a literature data on the activities and the sectors targeted by ESCOs in 38 countries, summarized in terms of the age of ESCO market (AEM), number of ESCO companies (NE), and total value of ESCO projects (VE). Along with the Global Innovation Index (GII) data of the countries, we investigate the relationships among the ESCO Indicators (EIs: AEM, NE, VE, sectors targeted by ESCOs), and the Country Indicators (CIs: GII and per-capita GDP, energy consumption, CO2 emission). We observe noteworthy dependencies between the EIs and CIs. Using the simple trend equations we estimate the missing VEs in the original data. We also project, as a hint for the size and orientation of the upcoming Turkish ESCO market, the set of EIs and the distribution of the sectors that are likely to be targeted by ESCOs in Turkey. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A general framework for handling a wide range of scheduling problems arising in multiproduct/multipurpose batch chemical plants is presented. Batch processes involving a variety of complexities are represented using a state-task network. The novel feature of this representation is that both the individual batch operations ("tasks") and the feedstocks, intermediate and final products ("states") are included explicitly as network nodes. Processes involving sharing of raw materials and intermediates, batch splitting and mixing and recycles of material, can be represented unambiguously as such networks. The short-term scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) based on a discrete time representation. Flexible equipment allocation, variable batchsizes and mixed intermediate storage policies involving both dedicated and multipurpose storage vessels are taken into account. Limited availability of raw materials, both at the start and during the time horizon of interest, is accommodated. Product deliveries may take place at any time during the horizon, and the amounts involved may be either fixed or variable. The use of utilities by the various tasks may vary over the task processing time, and may be constant or proportional to the batchsize. The availability and/or cost of utilities may vary over the time horizon of interest. The objective function is the maximization of a profit function involving the value of the products, and the cost of raw materials, utilities and material storage. The formulation may result in MILPs involving large numbers of binary variables. Issues pertaining to the efficient solution of these problems are discussed in Part II of this paper. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {In this study, an inexact community-scale energy model (ICS-EM) has been developed for planning renewable energy management (REM) systems under uncertainty. This method is based on an integration of the existing interval linear programming (ILP), chance-constrained programming (CCP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) techniques. ICS-EM allows uncertainties presented as both probability distributions and interval values to be incorporated within a general optimization framework. It can also facilitate capacity-expansion planning for energy-production facilities within a multi-period and multi-option context. Complexities in energy management systems can be systematically reflected, thus applicability of the modeling process can be highly enhanced. The developed method has then been applied to a case of long-term renewable energy management planning for three communities. Useful solutions for the planning of energy management systems have been generated. Interval solutions associated with different risk levels of constraint violation have been obtained. They can be used for generating decision alternatives and thus help decision makers identify desired policies under various economic and system-reliability constraints. The generated solutions can also provide desired energy resource/service allocation and capacity-expansion plans with a minimized system cost, a maximized system reliability and a maximized energy security. Tradeoffs between system costs and constraint-violation risks can also be tackled. Higher costs will increase system stability, while a desire for lower system costs will run into a risk of potential instability of the management system. They are helpful for supporting (a) adjustment or justification of allocation patterns of energy resources and services, (b) formulation of local policies regarding energy consumption, economic development and energy structure, and (c) analysis of interactions among economic cost, system reliability and energy-supply security. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Both single and multiple contaminants are addressed. The multiple-contaminant case allows multiple constraints relating to the multiple contaminants to be allowed for. Water regeneration opportunities are also identified at the targeting stage which distinguish between re-use and recycling. Two simple design methods are presented which allow targets both with and without regeneration to be achieved in design. The first design procedure maximises driving forces in individual processes whilst the second minimises the number of water sources for each process.

abstract = {Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been shown to apply well to optimizing the design and operations of water distribution systems (WDSs). The objective has usually been to minimize cost, subject to hydraulic constraints such as satisfying minimum pressure. More recently, the focus of optimization has expanded to include water quality concerns. This added complexity significantly increases the computational requirements of optimization. Considerable savings in computer time can be achieved by using a technique known as metamodeling. A metamodel is a surrogate or substitute for a complex simulation model. This research uses a metamodeling approach to optimize a water distribution design problem that includes water quality. The type of metamodels used are artificial neural networks (ANNs), as they are capable of approximating the nonlinear functions that govern flow and chlorine decay in a WDS. The ANNs were calibrated to provide a good approximation to the simulation model. In addition, two techniques are presented to improve the ability of metamodels to find the same optimal solution as the simulation model. Large savings in computer time occurred from training the ANNs to approximate chlorine concentrations (approximately 700 times faster than the simulation model) while still finding the optimal solution.},

The WCA is to the water surplus diagram in water pinch analysis (WPA) as problem table analysis (PTA) is to the grand composite curves in heat pinch analysis. By eliminating the tedious iterative steps of the water surplus diagram, the WCA can quickly yield accurate minimum water targets, pinch point locations, and water allocation targets for a maximum water recovery (MWR) network, thereby offering a key complementary role to the water surplus diagram in the synthesis of water network. As in the case of the water surplus diagram, the WCA is not limited to mass-transfer–based operations and is applicable to a wide range of water-using operations. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 50: 3169–3183, 2004},

There is plenty of documented evidence of past projects which have failed because they did not take into account the expressed needs and demands of the target population. The recognition of this weakness has prompted the World Bank and other donors to move towards a demand-responsive approach (DRA) to provision of services in recent years. The need to assess demand is central to this approach and there are a number of different tools and techniques which practitioners can use to assess demand. ... The aim of this study is to explore the issues and challenges surrounding the practice of demand assessment for water and sanitation services. The work has been based on an extensive review of literature and case studies and a one day workshop which was organised to draw together attitudes and knowledge from a small group of experienced economists, engineers and social scientists working in the sector. This study also links in with the recent World Bank-facilitated electronic conference on DRA. ... The three main tools which are currently available to assess demand are: household and revealed preference surveys, contingent valuation methodology (CVM) and participatory approaches (e.g. PRA). Each technique has proponents and opponents and has strengths and weaknesses in different contexts. Much of the expertise and experience of applying CVM comes from the World Bank which has conducted a global study into its use; in contrast, participatory tools are normally the domain of the social scientist or the NGO. In general, expensive and rigorous CVM studies can only be justified for large capital investments or changes in national policy or tariff restructuring whilst PRA is most effective for use on smallerscale rural projects with well-defined communities to work with.},

abstract = {Environmental decision-making occurs in numerous environmental sectors and covers a diverse range of problems. Of the various decision tools available not all of them may be appropriate for any single decision problem, and any particular decision-aid may not be applicable in all decision problems. This article reviews applications of MCA, and considers the appropriateness of Multicriteria Analysis (MCA) in environmental decision-making problems. Due to natural and decision environments being multidimensional, environmental decision-making is characterized by complexity. Consequently MCA has commonly been used in this area. In Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) the multiple dimensions of the impacts evaluated have been easily represented in MCA as multiple criteria. Waste management and water resource planning problems involving public participation have been facilitated by MCA, through the structuring and articulation of the public's values. MCA has also been applied in water quality problems, allowing the incorporation of incommensurable criteria into evaluations. The appropriateness of MCA for environmental decision problems can be viewed in the context of a typical decision-making process, making it easier to identify the contribution MCA can make at various decision-making stages. MCA can be particularly appropriate when the decision-making context is characterized by multiple objectives and multiple criteria, incommensurable criteria, mixed data and the need for ease of use, and the analysis context is characterized by multiple participants.},

abstract = {Urban metabolism is an important technique for understanding the relationship between cities and the wider environment. Such analyses are typically performed at the scale of the whole city using annual average data, a feature that is driven largely by restrictions in data availability. However, in order to assess the resource implications of policy interventions and to design and operate efficient urban infrastructures such as energy systems, greater spatial and temporal resolutions are required in the underlying resource demand data. As this information is rarely available, we propose that these demand profiles might be simulated using activity-based modeling. This is a microsimulation approach that calculates the activity schedules of individuals within the city and then converts this information into resource demands. The method is demonstrated by simulating electricity and natural gas demands in London and by examining how these nontransport energy demands might change in response to a shift in commuting patterns, for example, in response to a congestion charge or similar policy. The article concludes by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the approach, as well as highlighting future research directions. Key challenges include the simulation of in-home activities, assessing the transferability of the complex data sets and models supporting such analyses, and determining which aspects of urban metabolism would benefit most from this technique.},

abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: It is commonly asserted that so-called compact development is the urban form most able to sustainably accommodate growth by reducing travel distances and conserving land, but credible supportive evidence remains limited. This study rigorously and realistically tested the relative performance of spatial options over the next 30 years for three distinct kinds of English city regions. Statistical models first forecast the behavior of people within interacting markets for land and transport. These outputs were then fed to established simulation models to generate 26 indicators measuring the economic efficiency, resource use, social impact, and environmental impact of the spatial options. This permitted an explicit comparison of the costs and benefits of compact against sprawling urban forms for these regions. While the prototypes (i.e., compaction, sprawl, edge expansion, and new towns) were indeed found to differ in their sustainability, no one form was clearly superior. Rather, the change to “white collar” lifestyles and associated population growth dominates the impacts on the natural environment and resources, far overwhelming those attributable to spatial urban form. Takeaway for practice: Urban form policies can have important impacts on local environmental quality, economy, crowding, and social equity, but their influence on energy consumption and land use is very modest; compact development should not automatically be associated with the preferred spatial growth strategy. Research support: The research was funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council.},

abstract = {Energy is a vital input for social and economic development. As a result of the generalization of agricultural, industrial and domestic activities the demand for energy has increased remarkably, especially in emergent countries. This has meant rapid grower in the level of greenhouse gas emissions and the increase in fuel prices, which are the main driving forces behind efforts to utilize renewable energy sources more effectively, i.e. energy which comes from natural resources and is also naturally replenished. Despite the obvious advantages of renewable energy, it presents important drawbacks, such as the discontinuity of generation, as most renewable energy resources depend on the climate, which is why their use requires complex design, planning and control optimization methods. Fortunately, the continuous advances in computer hardware and software are allowing researchers to deal with these optimization problems using computational resources, as can be seen in the large number of optimization methods that have been applied to the renewable and sustainable energy field. This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in computational optimization methods applied to renewable and sustainable energy, offering a clear vision of the latest research advances in this field. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Urbanmetabolism studies have been established for only a few cities worldwide, and difficulties obtaining adequate statistical data are universal. Constraints and peculiarities call for inno- vative methods to quantify the materials entering and leaving city boundaries. Such methods include the extrapolation of data at the country or the region level based, namely, on sales, population, commuters, workers, and waste produced. The work described in this article offers a new methodol- ogy developed specifically for quantifying urbanmaterial flows, making possible the regular compilation of data pertinent to the characterization of a city's metabolism. This methodol- ogy was tested in a case study that characterized the urban metabolism of the city of Lisbon by quantifying Lisbon's ma- terial balance for 2004. With this aim, four variables were characterized and linked to material flows associated with the city: absolute consumption ofmaterials/products per category, throughput of materials in the urban system per material cate- gory, material intensity of economic activities, and waste flows per treatment technology. Results showthat annualmaterial consumption in Lisbon to- tals 11.223 million tonnes (20 tonnes per capita), and material outputs sum 2.149 million tonnes. Nonrenewable resources represent almost 80{\%} of the total material consumption, and renewables consumption (biomass) constitutes only 18{\%} of the total consumption. The remaining portion is made up of nonspecified materials. A seemingly excessive consumption amount of nonrenew- able materials compared to renewables may be the result of a large investment in building construction and a significant shift toward private car traveling, to the detriment of public transportation.},

abstract = {The deployment of plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) and micro-combined heat and power (micro-CHP) technologies create the opportunity to enhance energy service networks by coordinating these small-scale devices under various dispatch schemes. Furthermore, if vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and thermal storage features are considered, these embedded technologies could have even a greater impact on network performance. Therefore, this work presents a holistic modelling framework which serves as a tool to optimise in a coordinated manner the operation of natural gas and electrical infrastructures under the presence of distributed energy resources (DERs). The modelling tool developed, under the name TCOPF, is a decision maker entity that aggregates and coordinates the available DERs according to utility conditions. As a consequence, the tool functions by employing an integrated time coordinated electric and natural gas optimal power ow. Hence, once the results are analysed, the output allows stakeholders to identify techno-economical tradeo s that might be encountered by applying particular operating strategies and load control approaches. To illustrate the value of the modelling tool, a case study is assessed by evaluating di erent objective functions which simulate diverse operating strategies of utilities. The examples prove the TCOPF acts as an ecient intermediary entity that manages cost-e ective interactions between the connected technologies and the distribution network operators (DNOs). Results show considerable bene ts in operating electrical networks while simultaneously having mild e ects in natural gas networks. Furthermore, the modelling tool describes the optimal dispatch patterns distributed energy resources should follow in order to improve the performance of urban energy service networks. Thus, the TCOPF program o ers a fresh perspective for stakeholders wishing to successfully integrate and coordinate in a seamlessly fashion the operation of distributed energy resources with the operating strategies of energy utilities.},

abstract = {An inexact chance-constrained mixed-integer linear programming (ICMILP) model was provided for supporting long-term planning of solid waste management in the City of Beijing, China. The model was formulated by integrating interval-parameter, mixed-integer, and chance-constrained programming methods into a general framework, and effectively dealing with multiple uncertainties associated with model parameters and constraints. Three scenarios were examined for waste management in Beijing: scenario 1 is designed according to the current situation of waste management in the city, which has the lowest diversion rate among the three scenarios; scenario 2 is based on the balance between a long-term planning objective and the current situation with the medium diversion rate; and scenario 3 is based on a long-term planning objective which has the highest diversion rate among the three scenarios. Results from the model indicate that a solution with a lower significance level would lead to a higher system reliability and system cost; conversely, a desire for reducing system cost would result in an increased risk of violating the constraints. The solutions associate with these three scenarios show that scenario 1 has the lowest system cost, but also the lowest diversion rate. A landfill's lifespan may be prolonged by 5 and by 7 years under scenarios 2 and 3, respectively. A fuzzy MCDA model was applied for analyzing the optimal solutions among the three alternatives. With consideration of landfill lifespan, system cost, diversion rate, and public satisfaction, the results from the fuzzy MCDA method illustrate that scenario 3, which has the highest diversion rate and system cost, is the most favorable scheme for supporting the waste-management system in Beijing, and scenario 1, which has the lowest diversion rate and net system cost, is the least favorable solution among the different scenarios.

abstract = {Humanity has just crossed a major landmark in its history with the majority of people now living in cities. Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, beta, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have beta approximately 1.2 {\textgreater}1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display beta approximately 0.8 {\textless}1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which beta{\textless}1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.},

abstract = {Cities are responsible for nearly 75{\%} of the world's energy consumption; expectedly, about 90{\%} of future growth will occur in urban areas. However, we consider that cities will be at the forefront of implementing groundbreaking technologies and policies, as evidenced in the initiatives taken by many cities here and worldwide to resolve issues in energy and climate change. In addition to affording energy and environmental benefits, investments in energy efficient and renewable technologies have huge potential to boost local economies, as demonstrated by the recent federal allocation of stimulus funding. Inclined to give priority to stopgap measures, many cities tend to regard comprehensive long-term planning as secondary. However, such solutions would bring multiple benefits to the community. The paper showcases an energy and environment systems model to provide a quantitative vision of technology and management strategy options for effectively deploying energy efficiency and renewable energy for reducing the carbon footprint, while sustainably maintaining the energy demands of the community and the servicing environmental infrastructure. We provide results of a case study completed for New York City, to showcase usefulness of long-term planning for achieving low carbon cities. Combined with appropriate stakeholder participation, such a technology explicit bottom-up approach holds the promise of influencing the current energy planning, environmental regulatory regime, including multimedia aspects of carbon control for cities locally and internationally.},

abstract = {A multi-period optimal energy planning program for Ontario has been developed in mixed-integer non-linear programming using General Algebraic Modeling System, GAMS. The program applies both time-dependent and time-independent constraints. These include, but not limited to, construction time, fluctuation of fuel prices, and CO2 emission reduction target. It also offer flexibility of fuel balancing and fuel switching of the existing boilers and option purchasing of Carbon credit if the reduction target is not achievable. The objective function incorporates all these constraints as well as minimizes over all the cost of electricity and meets the projected electricity demand over a span of 14 years. Originally it was used for only two study cases which are the base case scenario for Ontario where no CO2 emission reduction target is applied and the 6{\%} reduction case to meet the Kyoto Protocol; to reduce its CO2 emission to 6{\%} below that of 1990. This project utilizes the program for various similar study cases and beyond. The Ontario's study cases include different CO2 emission reduction targets ranging from 6{\%} to 75{\%} below 1990 levels by 2012. The overall cost of the electricity for different CO2 emission reduction targets increases linearly with slope of 1.3. Carbon capture and sequestration, retrofitting of the carbon capture and storage, and fuel switching are the main strategy in order to keep the cost of electricity relative low and satisfy the CO2 emission constraints. These results help us better understand the factors affecting the fleet's structure. It may also help plan the energy direction of Ontario and perhaps serve as an example for other provinces, territories, states, and even countries. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Haberl2001,
abstract = {Based upon the currently emerging international consensus on how to account for the materials flows of industrialized countries, this article proposes methods to account for the energetic metabolism of societies. It argues that, to fully exploit the potential of the metabolism approach in the context of sustainable development, both energetic and material aspects of societal metabolism have to be taken into account. The article proposes concepts to empirically describe energy input, internal energy transformations, and energy utilization of societies by extending commonly used notions of energy statistics in a way that is compatible with current methods of materials flow analysis. Whereas energy statistics include only the energy used in technical devices for providing heat, light, mechanical work, and data processing, an accounting system for the energetic metabolism of societies should also consider flows of nutritional energy for both livestock and humans. Moreover, in assessing the energy input of a society, all inputs of energy-rich materials (and immaterial forms of energy such as electricity and light) that cross the boundary into the biophysical structures of society should be taken into consideration, regardless of the purpose for which they are eventually used. As a consequence, an energetic metabolism accounting system treats all biomass as energy input, instead of considering only the biomass used for technical energy generation, as energy statistics do. Part II in this set of articles will apply these concepts to different modes of societal organization and explore the significance of energetic metabolism for sustainable development. In particular, it will explore the significance for policies that aim at increasing the contribution of renewable energy, especially biomass.},

abstract = {We present the concept of sociometabolic regimes and use it to analyze patterns of change in global social metabolism. Sociometabolic regimes represent dynamic equilibria of society2013nature interactions and are characterized by typical patterns of material and energy flows (metabolic profiles). From this perspective, industrialization appears as a process of transition from the agrarian to the industrial regime. This article presents a global data set on the socioeconomic metabolism of 175 nations for the year 2000. We group the countries into six clusters differentiated by economic development and population density, reflecting the historical path of (agrarian) development and resource endowment. Our analysis reveals that per capita material and energy use in industrialized clusters is higher than in developing regions by a factor of 5 to 10. However, per capita use of natural resources differs significantly among industrialized clusters. A large fraction of the global population displays a metabolic profile somewhere in between the patterns typical for the agrarian and the industrial regimes. The sociometabolic transition from an agrarian to an industrial regime is thus an ongoing process with important consequences for future global material and energy demand. If we take a transition between regimes and the current characteristics of this transition as given, the global energy and materials demand is likely to grow by a factor of 2 to 3 during the coming decades. The most critical part of our findings relates to the cluster of high-density developing countries, as these countries already have a higher anthropogenic material and energy burden per unit of land area than, for example, industrial Europe, with pending further increases bound to surpass carrying capacities.},

abstract = {Part I of this set of articles proposed methods to account for the energetic metabolism of societies. In this second part, the methods explicated in Part I are used to analyze the energy flows of societies with different “modes of subsistence”: hunter-gatherers, a contemporary agricultural society in southeastern Asia, and a contemporary industrial society (Austria). The empirical examples are used to demonstrate differences in the “characteristic metabolism” of different modes of subsistence. The energy system of hunter-gatherers can be described as an “uncontrolled solar energy system,” based mainly upon harvesting biomass without attending to its reproduction. Hunter-gatherers use only about 0.001{\%} to 0.01{\%} of the net primary production (NPP) of the territory they inhabit. Agricultural societies harness NPP to a much higher extent: Although agriculture often reduces NPP, the amount of biomass that agricultural societies use is much higher (about 20{\%} of potential NPP). Because ecological energy flows are the main source of energy for agricultural societies, NPP strictly limits the energetic metabolism of agricultural societies. Industrial society uses area-independent energy sources (fossil and nuclear energy), which, however, result in new sustainability problems, such as greenhouse gas emissions. By providing methods to account for changes in energy flows, the metabolism approach proves itself to be a useful concept for analyzing society-environment interactions. The article demonstrates the difference between the metabolism approach and conventional energy statistics and discusses the significance of the proposed approach for sustainable development.},

abstract = {This work addresses the problem of water network synthesis. We propose a superstructure with fixed topology for a water network that consists of three layers, similar to a pooling problem: sources for reuse/recycle; regenerators for contaminants removal; and sinks for acceptance of water for reuse/recycle. The superstructure encompasses multiple freshwater sources, membrane separation-based partitioning regenerators of the industrially favored ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis, and sinks for incineration and deep ocean discharge. A mixed-integer nonlinear program is formulated based on this superstructure to determine the optimal interconnections in terms of total flowrates and contaminant concentrations. The main decisions include determining the split fractions of the source flowrates, extents of regeneration, and mixing ratios of the sources and regenerated streams subject to compliance with the maximum allowable inlet contaminant concentration limits of the sinks and discharge regulations. We also develop linear models for the membrane regenerators that admit a more general expression for the retentate stream concentration based on liquid-phase recovery factors and removal ratios. Computational studies are performed using GAMS/BARON on an industrially significant case study of a petroleum refinery water system. We incorporate linear logical constraints using 0-1 variables that enforce certain design and structural specifications to tighten the model formulation and enhance solution convergence.

Alternative approaches which consider water demands to be manageable and wastewater and stormwater as valuable resources, although being increasingly sought, lack reliable site specific implementation methodologies. This paper describes the development of a decision support tool (termed the Urban Water Optioneering Tool (UWOT)) to facilitate the selection of combinations of water saving strategies and technologies and to support the delivery of integrated, sustainable water management for new developments. The tool is based on a water balance model which allows the investigation of interactions between the major urban water cycle streams. The??model is informed by a knowledge library which is populated with technological options and information on their major characteristics and performance. The technology selection is driven by a GA algorithm allowing efficient exploration of the decision space. Quantitative and qualitative sustainability criteria and indicators are used to compare between alternative composite water management strategies while preserving the multiobjective nature of the problem. The tool has been successfully tested on??a case study site in the UK, and the results are presented and discussed.

abstract = {Data from urban metabolism studies from eight metropolitan regions across five continents, conducted in various years since 1965, are assembled in consistent units and compared. Together with studies of water, materials, energy, and nutrient flows from additional cities, the comparison provides insights into the changing metabolism of cities. Most cities studied exhibit increasing per capita metabolism with respect to water, wastewater, energy, and materials, although one city showed increasing efficiency for energy and water over the 1990s. Changes in solid waste streams and air pollutant emissions are mixed. The review also identifies metabolic processes that threaten the sustainability of cities. These include altered ground water levels, exhaustion of local materials, accumulation of toxic materials, summer heat islands, and irregular accumulation of nutrients. Beyond concerns over the sheer magnitudes of resource flows into cities, an understanding of these accumulation or storage processes in the urban metabolism is critical. Growth, which is inherently part of metabolism, causes changes in water stored in urban aquifers, materials in the building stock, heat stored in the urban canopy layer, and potentially useful nutrients in urban waste dumps. Practical reasons exist for understanding urban metabolism. The vitality of cities depends on spatial relationships with surrounding hinterlands and global resource webs. Increasing metabolism implies greater loss of farmland, forests, and species diversity; plus more traffic and more pollution. Urban policy makers should consider to what extent their nearest resources are close to exhaustion and, if necessary, appropriate strategies to slow exploitation. It is apparent from this review that metabolism data have been established for only a few cities worldwide, and interpretation issues exist due to lack of common conventions. Further urban metabolism studies are required.},

abstract = {Genetic algorithms are currently one of the state-of-the-art techniques for the optimisation of engineering systems including water network design and rehabilitation. They are capable of finding near optimal cost solutions to these problems given certain cost and hydraulic parameters. However, many forms of genetic algorithms rely on random starting points that are often poor solutions and the problem of how to efficiently provide good initial estimates of solution sets automatically is still an ongoing research topic. This paper proposes a novel method, known as CANDA-GA, which uses a heuristic-based, local representative cellular automata approach to provide a good initial population for genetic algorithm runs. CANDA-GA is applied to three networks, one taken from the literature and two taken from industry. The results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the conventional non-heuristic-based GA approach in terms of producing more economically designed water distribution networks.},

abstract = {The main findings of the project were:  The population of Greater London in 2000 was 7.4 million.  Londoners consumed 154,400 GigaWatt hours (GWh) of energy (or 13,276,000 tonnes of oil equivalent), which produced 41 million tonnes of CO2.  Londoners consumed 49 million tonnes of materials. On a per capita basis, this represents 6.7 tonnes.  27.8 million tonnes of materials were used by the construction sector.  26 million tonnes of waste was generated, of which 15 million tonnes was generated by the construction and demolition sector, 7.9 million tonnes by the commercial and industrial sector and 3.4 million tonnes by households.  6.9 million tonnes of food was consumed, of which 81{\%} was imported from outside the UK.  Londoners travelled 64 billion passengerkilometres (pass-km), of which 69{\%} was by car.  Water consumption reached 876,000,000,000 litres, of which 28{\%} was leakage. The ecological footprint of Londoners was 49 million global hectares (gha), which was 42 times its biocapacity and 293 times its geographical area. This is twice the size of the UK, and roughly the same size as Spain.  The ecological footprint per London resident was 6.63 gha. This compares with the UK average ecological footprint of 6.3 gha, and exceeds the global 'earthshare' of 2.18 gha.  The ecological footprint of London tourists was estimated at 2.4 million gha, which equates to an additional 0.32 gha per Londoner.  The predicted 'earthshare' in 2050 is estimated at 1.44 gha per capita. For Londoners to be ecologically sustainable by 2050, a 35{\%} reduction by 2020 and an 80{\%} reduction by 2050, of their ecological footprint will be needed.  Ranges of 'business as usual' and 'evolutionary' scenarios were prepared to reflect current practice and existing improvement targets. 'Revolutionary' scenarios were prepared to demonstrate that a combination of technological and behavioural changes could achieve interim sustainability targets for 2010},

abstract = {Traditionally the master-plan of an urban design development is centred around the land use schedule proposed by an urban design team. Technical teams (for transport, energy, waste, water, etc.) then each propose their individual strategy to maximise the sustainability of the site within their field of expertise. The methodology we present challenges this fragmented approach to sustainable design by assessing the sustainability of the whole design set, i.e. land use schedule and various strategies proposed, all at once. The IRM model processes inputs provided by each technical team, its calculations reflecting their respective strategies. It then outputs quantitative values to a comprehensive list of key performance indicators (e.g. energy consumption or total greenhouse gas emissions) defined within a framework set to appraise the sustainability of the whole design. Applied to a new development master-plan it has proven itself useful in either warning technical teams against inconsistencies between their individual strategies or in informing them on possibilities of improvement of the project's sustainability performance through a better integration of their strategies. Most importantly it has brought urban designers and technical teams to realise the interdependencies between strategies and the necessity to foresee these early enough within the design process.},

abstract = {Cities account for approximately two-thirds of global primary energy consumption and have large heat and power demands. CHP (combined heat and power) systems offer significant primary energy-efficiency gains and emissions reductions, but they can have high upfront investment costs and create nuisance pollution within the urban environment. Urban planners therefore need to understand the tradeoffs between limitations on CHP plant size and the performance of the overall energy system. This paper uses a mixed-integer linear programming model to evaluate urban energy system designs for a range of city sizes and technology scenarios. The results suggest that the most cost-effective and energy-efficient scenarios require a mix of technology scales including CHP plants of appropriate size for the total urban demand. For the cities studied here (less than 200,000 people), planning restrictions that prevent the use of CHP technologies could lead to total system cost penalties of 2{\%} (but with significantly different cost structures) and energy-efficiency penalties of up to 24{\%} when measured against a boiler-only business-as-usual case. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for evaluating investments in decentralized renewable power generation under price un certainty. The analysis is applicable for a client with an electricity load and a renewable resource that can be utilized for power generation. The investor has a deferrable opportunity to invest in one local power generating unit, with the objective to maximize the profits from the opportunity. Renewable electricity generation can serve local load when generation and load coincide in time, and surplus power can be exported to the grid. The problem is to find the price intervals and the capacity of the generator at which to invest. Results from a case with wind power generation for an office building suggests it is optimal to wait for higher prices than the net present value break-even price under price uncertainty, and that capacity choice can depend on the current market price and the price volatility. With low price volatility there can be more than one investment price interval for different units with intermediate waiting regions between them. High price volatility increases the value of the investment opportunity, and therefore makes it more attractive to postpone investment until larger units are profitable. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the recently released United Nations' publication World Urbanization Prospects is an invaluable resource for those interested in studying urban change, the data in the report are somewhat deceptive in their apparent completeness and beyond the narrow confines of technical demography there is a great deal of misunderstanding and misreporting about what these data mean and how they should be interpreted. For example, while the scale of urban change is unprecedented and the nature and direction of urban change is more dependent on the global economy than ever before, many aspects of the traditional distinction between urban and rural are becoming redundant. This paper provides a broad overview of the available evidence on patterns and trends in urban growth in developing countries, highlighting regional differences where appropriate. The paper also examines the quality of past urban population projections and finds that there has been considerable diversity in their quality by geographic region, level of development, and size of country. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this study, an interval-parameter two-stage mixed integer linear programming (ITMILP) model is developed for supporting long-term planning of waste management activities in the City of Regina. In the ITMILP, both two-stage stochastic programming and interval linear programming are introduced into a general mixed integer linear programming framework. Uncertainties expressed as not only probability density functions but also discrete intervals can be reflected. The model can help tackle the dynamic, interactive and uncertain characteristics of the solid waste management system in the City, and can address issues concerning plans for cost-effective waste diversion and landfill prolongation. Three scenarios are considered based on different waste management policies. The results indicate that reasonable solutions have been generated. They are valuable for supporting the adjustment or justification of the existing waste flow allocation patterns, the long-term capacity planning of the City's waste management system, and the formulation of local policies and regulations regarding waste generation and management. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Carbon fluxes scenario within urban areas plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, which is critical for the adjustment of urban development activities influencing our living environment. Adapting network environ theory, a generic metabolic model is developed in this study for carbon metabolism in urban areas, in which compartmental utility analysis and system performance assessment are featured. Taking carbon dynamic of Hong Kong as a case study, the metabolic flows within urban carbon balance are illustrated though two analogous input/output networks. Based on this, the compartmental mutual relationships between different urban sectors are addressed and the overall properties of the city's carbon metabolism are aggregately evaluated. Our findings showed that each metabolic component has its specific mutual relations with other components connected, playing a unique role within the ecological system. As to Hong Kong's case, specifically, the metabolic system is considered self-mutual and stable when incorporating its interactions with its supporting environment. In light of these insights, potential extensions and applications of the network-based metabolic model in future are discussed. The recommendation is that the tracking of interactive relationships and pathways from network environ perspective be incorporated into present urban metabolism study for a more comprehensive sustainable urban design.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide a broad overview of the recent patterns and trends of urban growth in developing countries. Over the last 20 years many urban areas have experienced dramatic growth, as a result of rapid population growth and as the world's economy has been transformed by a combination of rapid technological and political change. Around 3 billion people - virtually half of the world's total population-now live in urban settlements. And while cities command an increasingly dominant role in the global economy as centers of both production and consumption, rapid urban growth throughout the developing world is seriously outstripping the capacity of most cities to provide adequate services for their citizens. Over the next 30 years, virtually all of the world's population growth is expected to be concentrated in urban areas in the developing world. While much of the current sustainable cities debate focuses on the formidable problems for the world's largest urban agglomerations, the majority of all urban dwellers continue to reside in far smaller urban settlements. Many international agencies have yet to adequately recognize either the anticipated rapid growth of small and medium cities or the deteriorating living conditions of the urban poor. The challenges of achieving sustainable urban development will be particularly formidable in Africa. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Energy use in cities has attracted significant research in recent years. However such a broad topic inevitably results in number of alternative interpretations of the problem domain and the modelling tools used in its study. This paper seeks to pull together these strands by proposing a theoretical definition of an urban energy system model and then evaluating the state of current practice. Drawing on a review of 219 papers, five key areas of practice were identified - technology design, building design, urban climate, systems design, and policy assessment - each with distinct and incomplete interpretations of the problem domain. We also highlight a sixth field, land use and transportation modelling, which has direct relevance to the use of energy in cities but has been somewhat overlooked by the literature to date. Despite their diversity, these approaches to urban energy system modelling share four common challenges in understanding model complexity, data quality and uncertainty, model integration, and policy relevance. We then examine the opportunities for improving current practice in urban energy systems modelling, focusing on the potential of sensitivity analysis and cloud computing, data collection and integration techniques, and the use of activity-based modelling as an integrating framework. The results indicate that there is significant potential for urban energy systems modelling to move beyond single disciplinary approaches towards a sophisticated integrated perspective that more fully captures the theoretical intricacy of urban energy systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Municipal solid waste (MSW) should be properly disposed in order to help protect environmental quality and human health, as well as to preserve natural resources. During MSW disposal processes, a large amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) is emitted, leading to a significant impact on climate change. In this study, an inexact dynamic optimization model (IDOM) is developed for MSW-management systems under uncertainty. It grounds upon conventional mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approaches, and integrates GHG components into the modeling framework. Compared with the existing models, IDOM can not only deal with the complex tradeoff between system cost minimization and GHG-emission mitigation, but also provide optimal allocation strategies under various emission-control standards. A case study is then provided for demonstrating applicability of the developed model. The results indicate that desired waste-flow patterns with a minimized system cost and GHG-emission amount can be obtained. Of more importance, the IDOM solution is associated with over 5.5 million tonnes of TEC reduction, which is of significant economic implication for real implementations. Therefore, the proposed model could be regarded as a useful tool for realizing comprehensive MSW management with regard to mitigating climate-change impacts. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Ostergaard2009,
abstract = {The utilisation of fluctuating renewable energy sources is increasing world-wide; however, so is the concern about how to integrate these resources into the energy systems. The design of optimal energy resource mixes in climate change mitigation actions is a challenge faced in many places. This optimisation may be implemented according to economic objectives or with a focus on techno-operational aims and within these two main groupings, several different criteria may potentially be applied to the design process. In this article, a series of optimisation criteria are reviewed and subsequently applied to an energy system model of Western Denmark in an analysis of how to use heat pumps for the integration of wind power. The analyses demonstrate that the fact whether the system in question is modelled as operated in island mode or not has a large impact on the definition of the optimal wind power level. If energy savings and CO2 emission reductions beyond the system boundary are not included in the analysis, then it is either not feasible to expand wind power to a high degree or it is conversely more feasible to install relocation technologies that can utilise any excess production. The analyses also demonstrate that different optimisation criteria render different optimal designs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the last decade, technological innovations and a changing economic and regulatory environment have resulted in a renewed interest for distributed energy resources (DER). However, because of the lack of a suitable design tool, the expected potential of DER penetration is not always exerted sufficiently. In this paper, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model has been developed for the integrated plan and evaluation of DER systems. Given the site's energy loads, local climate data, utility tariff structure, and information (both technical and financial) on candidate DER technologies, the model minimizes overall energy cost for a test year by selecting the units to install and determining their operating schedules. Furthermore, the economic, energetic and environmental effects of the DER system can be evaluated. As an illustrative example, an investigation has been conducted of economically optimal DER system for an eco-campus in Kitakyushu, Japan. The result illustrates that gas engine is currently the most popular DER technology from the economic point of view. Although holding reasonable economic merits, unless combined with heat recovery units, the introduction of DER technologies may result in marginal or even adverse environmental effects. Furthermore, according to the results of sensitivity analysis, the optimal system combination and corresponding economic and environmental performances are more or less sensitive to the scale of energy demand, energy prices (both electricity and city gas), as well as carbon tax rate. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It does so in the context of recent contributions to a debate on the nature of urban management (Stren, 1993, Cities 10 120–138; Mattingly, 1994, Cities 11(3) 201–205; Werna, 1995, Cities 12(5) 353–359). The paper therefore considers various definitions of the process. This is seen to focus on both the strategic and operational concerns of urban development. It considers the holistic characteristics. This embraces both city and institution building. The contribution of town planning is assessed. This is viewed as a disappointment, despite its potential relevance. The process of providing infrastructure is assessed. This requires all the players to participate, irrespective of organisational location. Integrating the organisational arrangements is therefore acknowledged. This helps to confound attempts to impose an idealised organisational model for urban management, emphasising instead inter-organisational arrangements and their unifying planning process. The wider aim to decentralise urban management is acknowledged. Hence, urban management should be driven by the lowest level of competent government. Urban management is therefore seen to have a twin objective: first, to plan for, provide and maintain a city's infrastructure and services, and second, to make sure that the city's government is in a fit state, organisationally and financially, to ensure that provision and maintenance.},

To better tackle these challenges there is an urgent need for the development of new approaches where the integration of different urban infrastructural systems leads to resource savings and synergy. Specifically the development and testing of new modeling techniques emphasizing the network sustainability of integrated urban systems is warranted. Past modeling techniques such as emergy, exergy, and extended exergy analysis highlight the sustainability of the urban ecology from an accounting perspective, however there have been few research inroads in utilizing information indices for urban ecological modeling whereby sustainability from the network perspective is evaluated.

Much research has been developed around optimizing pipeline design assuming a predetermined geographical layout of the distribution system. There has been less work done, however, on the problem of optimizing the configuration of the network itself, which is a particularly crucial issue in lower-income areas where the need for cost-effective irrigation systems is greatest. Generally, engineers develop the basic layout through experience and sheer intuition. In this paper, a method is developed for determining an optimal layout for a branched distribution system given only the spatial distribution of potential customers and their respective demands. The technique utilizes a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) algorithm to optimize an empirically derived objective function. The method is tailored for practical application and allows the decision maker to simultaneously solve for the optimal customer/user base and pipeline layout. The method is illustrated with a simple example.},

abstract = {This paper reports on an integration of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and inexact mixed integer linear programming (IMILP) methods to support selection of an optimal landfill site and a waste-flow-allocation pattern such that the total system cost can be minimized. Selection of a landfill site involves both qualitative and quantitative criteria and heuristics. In order to select the best landfill location, it is often necessary to compromise among possibly conflicting tangible and intangible factors. Different multi-objective programming models have been proposed to solve the problem. A weakness with the different multi-objective programming models used to solve the problem is that they are basically mathematical and ignore qualitative and often subjective considerations such as the risk of groundwater pollution as well as other environmental and socio-economic factors which are important in landfill selection. The selection problem also involves a change in allocation pattern of waste-flows required by construction of a new landfill. A waste flow refers to the routine of transferring waste from one location in a city to another. In selection of landfill locations, decision makers need to consider both the potential sites that should be used as well as the allocation pattern of the waste-flow at different periods of time. This paper reports on our findings in applying an integrated IMILP/MCDA approach for solving the solid waste management problem in a prairie city. The five MCDA methods of simple weighted addition, weighted product, co-operative game theory, TOPSIS, and complementary ELECTRE are adopted to evaluate the landfill site alternatives considered in the solid waste management problem, and results from the evaluation process are presented. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to review the types of models that are currently being used in the area of municipal waste management and to highlight some major shortcomings of these models. Most of the municipal waste models identified in the literature are decision support models and for the purposes of this research, are divided into three categories - those based on cost benefit analysis, those based on life cycle assessment and those based on multicriteria decision making. Shortcomings of current waste management models include that they are concerned with refinements of the evaluation steps (e.g. stage four of AHP or the improvement of weight allocations in ELECTRE) rather than addressing the decision making process itself. In addition, while many models recognise that for a waste management model to be sustainable, it must consider environmental, economic and social aspects, no model examined considered all three aspects together in the application of the model. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {During winter, district heating systems may be used to heat dense built environment in large cities. After several years of use, performance of such a system would change because of either refurbishment or ageing. As a result, air temperatures in heated rooms would be different from the design (thermal comfort) temperatures. It is investigated how the system performance changes owing to ageing and refurbishment of the primary pipeline and envelope of heated buildings. To determine how to recover the design temperatures of air in heated rooms, mixed integer linear programming is used. The objective was to select an optimal scenario that would achieve the minimum difference between the corrected and design temperatures inside the investigated rooms. The scenario refers to installation of new (option) valves and water pumps that would require installing in the primary pipe network of the old district heating system examined to re-establish its optimum performance.

@article{Daigger2009,
abstract = {Population growth and improving standards of living, coupled with dramatically increased urbanization, are placing increased pressures on available water resources, necessitating new approaches to urban water management. The tradition linear "take, make, waste" approach to managing water increasingly is proving to be unsustainable, as it is leading to water stress (insufficient water supplies), unsustainable resource (energy and chemicals) consumption, the dispersion of nutrients into the aquatic environment (especially phosphorus), and financially unstable utilities. Different approaches are needed to achieve economic, environmental, and social sustainability. Fortunately, a toolkit consisting of stormwater management/rainwater harvesting, water conservation, water reclamation and reuse, energy management, nutrient recovery, and source separation is available to allow more closed-loop urban water and resource management systems to be developed and implemented. Water conservation and water reclamation and reuse (multiple uses) are becoming commonplace in numerous water-short locations. Decentralization, enabled by new, high-performance treatment technologies and distributed stormwater management/rainwater harvesting, is furthering this transition. Likewise, traditional approaches to residuals management are evolving, as higher levels of energy recovery are desired, and nutrient recovery and reuse is to be enhanced. A variety of factors affect selection of the optimum approach for a particular urban area, including local hydrology, available water supplies, water demands, local energy and nutrient-management situations, existing infrastructure, and utility governance structure. A proper approach to economic analysis is critical to determine the most sustainable solutions. Stove piping (i.e., separate management of drinking, storm, and waste water) within the urban water and resource management profession must be eliminated. Adoption of these new approaches to urban water and resource management can lead to more sustainable solutions, defined as financially stable, using locally sustainable water supplies, energy-neutral, providing responsible nutrient management, and with access to clean water and appropriate sanitation for all.},

abstract = {This paper develops a decision support framework that assists managers in the urban water industry to analyse a mix of water service options, at the whole-of-city scale. The decision support framework moves decision-making in urban water systems from traditional command and control approaches that tend to focus on an outcome at a point in time to a more sustainable, inclusive and dynamic decision-making process driven by social learning and engagement. While available models and evaluation techniques provide valuable input to decision-making, the complex nature of urban water systems requires more than just social and economic criteria to be considered as part of decision support frameworks. The authors believe that current decision support frameworks need to be presented in a way that incorporates adaptive management and integrated urban water management strengths at the strategic and operational level. The inclusion of social learning and engagement is necessary to achieving this end.},

The review finds that there are two related, non-conflicting, schools of urban metabolism: one following Odum describes metabolism in terms of energy equivalents; while the second more broadly expresses a city's flows of water, materials and nutrients in terms of mass fluxes. Four example applications of urban metabolism studies are discussed: urban sustainability indicators; inputs to urban greenhouse gas emissions calculation; mathematical models of urban metabolism for policy analysis; and as a basis for sustainable urban design. Future directions include fuller integration of social, health and economic indicators into the urban metabolism framework, while tackling the great sustainability challenge of reconstructing cities. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Energy systems have changed from using water for mechanical energy to building dams to provide irrigation water for agriculture and hydroelectricity. Large volumes of water are required to cool thermal electricity-generating stations—whether coal, natural gas, nuclear, or solar powered. Changes in cooling technology are reducing water withdrawals while increasing water consumption. Water produced from fossil fuel production represents environmental challenges and supply opportunities. Some renewable energy sources, such as wind turbines and photovoltaics, have far lower water requirements. Increasing development of biofuels creates a direct connection between water and energy systems. Energy, mostly for pumps, is necessary for supplying potable water and treating wastewater.

Equations for determining emissions are developed for contributions from: electricity; heating and industrial fuels; ground transportation fuels; air and marine fuels; industrial processes; and waste. Gasoline consumption is estimated using three approaches: from local fuel sales; by scaling from regional fuel sales; and from counts of vehicle kilometres travelled. A simplified version of an intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) method for estimating the GHG emissions from landfill waste is applied. Three measures of overall emissions are suggested: (i) actual emissions within the boundary of the city; (ii) single process emissions (from a life-cycle perspective) associated with the city's metabolism; and (iii) life-cycle emissions associated with the city's metabolism. The results and analysis of the study will be published in a second paper. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A simulation model, ORWARE (ORganic WAste REsearch) is described. The model is mainly used as a tool for researchers in environmental systems analysis of waste management. It is a computer-based model for calculation of substance flows, environmental impacts, and costs of waste management. The model covers, despite the name, both organic and inorganic fractions in municipal waste. The model consists of a number of separate submodels, which describes a process in a real waste management system. The submodels may be combined to design a complete waste management system. Based on principles from life cycle assessment the model also comprises compensatory processes for conventional production of e.g. electricity, district heating and fertiliser. The compensatory system is included in order to fulfil the functional units, i.e. benefits from the waste management that are kept constant in the evaluation of different scenarios. ORWARE generates data on emissions, which are aggregated into different environmental impact categories, e.g. the greenhouse effect, acidification and eutrophication. Throughout the model all physical flows are described by the same variable vector, consisting of up to 50 substances. The extensive vector facilitates a thorough analysis of the results, but involves some difficulties in acquiring relevant data. Scientists have used ORWARE for 8 years in different case studies for model testing and practical application in the society. The aims have e.g. been to evaluate waste management plans and to optimise energy recovery from waste.},

The book (to be referred to here as The Next Step) includes six examples of sustainable urban design and three major essays. The Working Group is a broad group of experts from the Dutch professional societies for urban designers and planners (BNSP) and landscape architects (NVTL). (The working group consists of urban designers, urban planers and landscape architects from the Netherlands.) It seeks to take the thinking and practice of sustainable urban design a step further: from sustainable urban design to sustainable spatial development. This paper explains this next stage which has been developed through a review of the literature, the inputs of the Working Group and the lessons learned from the case studies described in the book. Although the case study projects are sometimes more than 12. years old and are rooted in a specific Dutch societal and spatial context, they provide interesting, even up to date, insights for the planning of sustainable and durable cities. They are also compared to some projects in other European countries. This paper looks at why a renewed approach to sustainable urban design is both necessary and rewarding. It then turns to the renewed approach and putting it into practice. Based upon the case studies, new possibilities for the design of sustainable and durable cities are highlighted. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The application of anaerobic co-digestion of food waste with sewage sludge, although well established in many European countries, is still in its infancy in the UK. This process has many benefits to offer, with a successful application often associated with increased renewable energy potential, outweighing constraints associated with the variability of food waste and its handling requirements prior to co-digestion. With both regulations and water infrastructures designed and constructed on the basis of linear views and sectorial requirements and conditions and technologies from the past in many parts of the world, in the UK, sewage sludge and food waste digestion operations are also under very different regulatory and management regimes. With sustainability requiring that we do not address single issues in isolation, but through a systems approach that delivers integrated solutions, co-digestion of food waste with sewage sludge could become such a solution. If carefully applied, co-digestion can deliver beneficial synergies for the water industry and authorities responsible for food waste management. The collaboration of all relevant stakeholders and regulators to support changes to current regulatory frameworks to enable this, is proposed as the way forward, particularly as their complexity has been identified as the major hurdle to the implementation of co-digestion in the UK. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The article presents the results of a research project aimed at (1) examining the feasibility of material flow analysis (MFA) on a regional and urban scale in France, (2) selecting the most appropriate method, (3) identifying the available data, and (4) calculating the material balance for a specific case. Using the Eurostat method, the study was conducted for the year 2003 and for three regional levels: Paris, Paris and its suburbs, and the entire region. Applying the method on a local scale required two local indicators to be defined in order to take into account the impact of exported wastes on MFA: LEPO, local and exported flows to nature, and DMCcorr, a modified domestic material consumption (DMC) that excludes exported wastes (and imported ones if necessary). As the region extracts, produces, and transforms less material than the country as a whole, its direct material input (DMI) is lower than the national DMI. In all the areas, LEPO exceeds 50{\%} of DMI; in contrast, recycling is very low. The multiscale approach reveals that urban metabolism is strongly impacted by density and the distribution of activities: the dense city center (Paris) exports all of its wastes to the other parts of the region and concentrates food consumption, whereas the agricultural and urban sprawl area consumes high levels of construction materials and fuel. This supports the use of MFA on an urban and regional scale as a basis for material flow management and dematerialization strategies and clearly reveals the important interactions between urban and regional planning and development, and material flows.

abstract = {The reduction of CO2 emissions linked with human activities (mainly energy services and transport), together with the increased use of renewable energies, remain high priorities on various political agendas. However, considering the increased consumption of energy services (especially electricity), and the stochastic nature of some of the most promising renewable energies (wind for instance), the challenge is to find the optimal mix of technologies that will provide the energy services, without increasing the CO2 emissions, but nonetheless ensuring reliability of supply. The focus of this paper is to present the DESDOP tool, based on mixed integer linear optimisation technics, that helps giving insight in the optimal mix of technologies that will simultaneously help decrease the emissions while at the same time guarantee resilience of supply. The results show that while it is not yet possible to avoid electricity from the grid completely (hence nuclear or fossil fuel), CO2 reductions up to 20{\%}, at no extra costs compared to the business-as-usual case, are easily achievable. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was used to compare the environmental loads from wastewater systems with different technical solutions. This study compared proposed conventional wastewater systems, both large and small scale, with separation systems: one in which urine is handled separately and one in which black water is treated in a liquid composting process. The study showed that large economies of scale, in environmental terms, could be gained both for the operation and for the construction phase. The separation systems outperformed the conventional systems by showing lower emissions to water and more efficient recycling of nutrients to agriculture, especially of nitrogen but also of phosphorus. This implies that the use of separation systems could significantly reduce the need for, and hence the production of, mineral fertilizers and thus reduce the overall use of energy and phosphate minerals. The combination of large- scale wastewater treatment and urine separation was found to be especially advantageous in these respects. It is concluded thatsomeof the most important environmental advantages of separation systems emerge only when models of wastewater systems are expanded to also include potential effects on the production of fertilizers},

abstract = {In this paper, a new optimal design method for building energy systems is proposed. This method provides the most efficient energy system, best combination of equipment capacity and best operational planning for cooling, heating, and power simultaneously with respect to certain criteria such as energy consumption, CO2 emission, etc. Specifically for this paper, the authors apply this method to a sample building as a case study. The "Genetic Algorithms (GA)" optimization method, which can resolve nonlinear optimization problems, is adopted for this optimization analysis. Also its applicability is analyzed in a case study. In order to validate the accuracy of this method, the correct optimum solution based on comprehensive inquiries is also calculated. A comparison of the GA solution with the correct solution demonstrates fairly good agreement. The results show that the proposed method is sufficiently capable of determining the optimal design and has the potential to be applied to very complex energy systems with appropriate modifications. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper analyses different alternatives for solid waste management that can be implemented to enable the targets required by the European Landfill and Packaging and Packaging Waste Directives to be achieved in the Valencian Community, on the east coast of Spain. The methodology applied to evaluate the environmental performance of each alternative is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The analysis has been performed at two levels; first, the emissions accounted for in the inventory stage have been arranged into impact categories to obtain an indicator for each category; and secondly, the weighting of environmental data to a single unit has been applied. Despite quantitative differences between the results obtained with four alternative impact assessment methods, the same preference ranking has been established: Scenarios with energy recovery (1v and 2v) achieve major improvements compared to baseline, with scenario 1v being better than 2v for all impact assessment methods except for the EPS'00 method, which obtains better results for scenario 2v. Sensitivity analysis has been used to test some of the assumptions used in the initial life cycle inventory model but none have a significant effect on the overall results. As a result, the best alternative to the existing waste management system can be identified. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The model comprises two modules - daily and hourly. The daily module is formulated as a set of equations representing the effects of three factors on water use namely seasonality, climatic correlation, and autocorrelation. The hourly module is developed to disaggregate the estimated daily consumption into hourly consumption. The models were calibrated using hourly and daily data for a 6 year period, and independently validated over an additional seven month period. Over this latter period, the hourly forecast model accounted for 66{\%} of the variance in the peak hourly water consumption with a standard error of 162 l/p/d. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Conventional urban water management practices aim to meet water supply-demands while conveying wastewater and stormwater away from urban settings. Alternative approaches which consider water demands to be manageable and wastewater and stormwater as valuable resources, although being increasingly sought, lack reliable site specific implementation methodologies. This paper describes the development of a decision support tool (termed the Urban Water Optioneering Tool (UWOT)) to facilitate the selection of combinations of water saving strategies and technologies and to support the delivery of integrated, sustainable water management for new developments. The tool is based on a water balance model which allows the investigation of interactions between the major urban water cycle streams. The??model is informed by a knowledge library which is populated with technological options and information on their major characteristics and performance. The technology selection is driven by a GA algorithm allowing efficient exploration of the decision space. Quantitative and qualitative sustainability criteria and indicators are used to compare between alternative composite water management strategies while preserving the multiobjective nature of the problem. The tool has been successfully tested on??a case study site in the UK, and the results are presented and discussed. It is suggested that "optioneering" tools will increasingly become part of urban water management planning toolkits as practice moves towards more decentralised, integrated, context-specific solutions to address issues of sustainability. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Due to fast urbanization and increasing living standards, the environmental sustainability of our global society becomes more and more questionable. In this historical review we investigate the role of resources management (RM) and urban planning (UP) and propose ways for integration in sustainable development (SD). RM follows the principle of circular causation, and we reflect on to what extent RM has been an element for urban planning. Since the existence of the first settlements, a close relationship between RM, urbanization and technological development has been present. RM followed the demand for urban resources like water, energy, and food. In history, RM has been fostered by innovation and technology developments and has driven population growth and urbanization. Recent massive resource demand, especially in relation to energy and material flows, has altered natural ecosystems and has resulted in environmental degradation. UP has developed separately in response to different questions. UP followed the demand for improved living conditions, often associated to safety, good manufacturing and trading conditions and appropriate sanitation and waste management. In history UP has been a developing research area, especially since the industrial era and the related strong urbanization at the end of the 18th century. UP responded to new emerging problems in urban areas and became increasingly complex. Nowadays, UP has to address many objectives that are often conflicting, including, the urban sustainability. Our current urban un-sustainability is rooted in massive resource consumption and waste production beyond natural limits, and the absence of flows from waste to resources. Therefore, sustainable urban development requires integration of RM into UP. We propose new ways to this integration. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Urban water planning and policy have been focusing on environmentally benign and economically viable water management. The objective of this study is to develop a mathematical model to integrate and optimize urban water infrastructures for supply-side planning and policy: freshwater resources and treated wastewater are allocated to various water demand categories in order to reduce contaminants in the influents supplied for drinking water, and to reduce consumption of the water resources imported from the regions beyond a city boundary. A case study is performed to validate the proposed model. An optimal urban water system of a metropolitan city is calculated on the basis of the model and compared to the existing water system. The integration and optimization decrease (i) average concentrations of the influents supplied for drinking water, which can improve human health and hygiene; (ii) total consumption of water resources, as well as electricity, reducing overall environmental impacts; (iii) life cycle cost; and (iv) water resource dependency on other regions, improving regional water security.
